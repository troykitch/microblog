			 <p>We acquired a massive cabinet from a friend when we lived in Germany. It was circa 1920s and is what I’d call “proto-IKEA,” in that it was designed to be disassembled, presumably because it was so huge and heavy. We grew attached to it over the years, but the problem we faced is that it didn’t fit in our new small home. So this project entailed converting the full size monster into something much smaller by removing the center section and building a new base and top. I had three goals for the build: (1) make a new cabinet using the sides and doors of the old cabinet that could also be easily disassembled; (2) make the new cabinet stronger; (3) only use hand tools. The main challenge: nothing was square in the old cabinet. Each door was a different width, the sides were not square, and the existing wood was warped.</p>
<p>Here’s what the full-sized cabinet looked like in our previous home. It was about seven feet wide.</p>
<p>​<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Here’s the completed “mini cabinet” in our new home:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s a brief-ish overview of the process.</p>
<p>I made the four legs out of some sapele I had on hand. I cut each leg in an L shape to match up with the doors to give it a more seamless look. Then used mortise and tenons to build the frame with cherry.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s the base support, dry fit. I used cherry for the show faces of the project.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For the floor of the cabinet, I used poplar. On each end that would be supporting one of the cabinet walls, I decided to use dovetailed boards for added stability to keep it all together nicely.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For the legs, I used chisels and a saw to slowly shape them out to fit the dovetailed poplar.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s the completed right side of the base.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It ended up having quite complex joinery, but it all worked out. These end pieces of the base frame will support each cabinet side.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s the base dry fit, each poplar board is shiplapped.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The trickiest part of the project was figuring out how to support each wall. The original cabinet has only a single center pin on each side holding the side in place, but these pins were just slotted in and didn’t offer any support. It was basically held together just by the weight of the top. Each side also slots into the base and top with a what is basically a long mortise and tenon. So I had to come up with a plan for the base and top to fit these long “tenons” and also to strengthen how each side attached to the base.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That’s what the following shot shows. The center hole fits the pre-existing pin. Then I added two new holes on each side and inserted a thread in each so I could bolt it in place with a hex wrench. Each side piece also slots into the base.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The top was a much simpler affair. I first cut and shaped the top front.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I went with dovetails for the top frame to keep it all together nicely. I closed up the top with a 1/2 inch plywood insert that is removable so if we need to take it apart again it’ll be easy to move.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is the completed cabinet showing the interior. The back is 1/2 plywood. The shelf was re-used from the old cabinet and just had to be cut to size. The nice thing about the design is that base, top, sides, doors, and back are all removable, so it can be knocked down if needed to transport easily. I took the rosette from the old cabinet and placed in on the new top (it was just a nailed-on affair, this was not a high-end cabinet). I&rsquo;m happy with how it turned out.</p>

<p>I completed a side project to repurpose my old 2002 iMac into a stand to hold my iPad Pro for when I’m in my workshop. The base is completely gutted so I had to weight it so it balanced correctly. The iPad is held in place by another repurposed thing: an old iPad Smart Keyboard case that I cut down to size so it is only the magnetized part. Strong, small magnets are attached on the back of this case that connect up to magnets embedded in the sapele wood where the monitor used to be. So I can remove the iPad and the case.</p>
<p>The drive slot is wood veneer — I discovered there is just enough of a gap between the plastic body and the underlying metal frame to slide the veneer strips in to make for a nice presentation. I use my iPad in the shop for entertainment and planning projects, so I can grab it when I’m designing then hang it up here out of the way when I just want music or to watch the occasional video.</p>
<p>I’ve been lugging this old iMac around for decades just to someday do something interesting with it, because I love this design. So this is that. On a side note, I think the design of the iMac arm, and this design generally, is genius. Hope to see a modern version of a tilt and swivel arm used in some Apple product in the future.</p>

			 <p>I recently completed my project to turn an early 20th century sewing station into a 21st century internet station. I used sapele for this build (second only to walnut as my favorite handtool wood to work with). Here is some documentation so I don’t forget what I did.</p>
<h3 id="securing-the-cabinet-to-the-cast-iron-base">Securing the cabinet to the cast iron base</h3>
<p>I made a simple base from a scrap piece of bubinga I had laying around. It’s held in place by two walnut dowels I hand cut (pounded out with a dowel plate) to fit through the existing cast iron screw holes where the base of the old treadle was held in place with big screws. These dowels go through the screw holes and into the wood where I drilled some holes. My aim for this project was to complete it without any screws or other hardware, so these two dowels and two top dowels I document later are what keep in solidly locked in place.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="building-the-cabinet">Building the cabinet</h3>
<p>I had to join two boards to have the width I needed for the base and sides.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Each side was cut at angles to match the angle of the cast iron sewing machine table base.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The base of the cabinet was a simple square, thankfully no angles.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The sides were joined to the base with dovetails, I used a variable width just because I had never tried to do differing widths before. Turned out well.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This cabinet is for computer bits that get warm, so I wanted to maximize airflow, so I left the top open, held in place with two dovetailed arms in the front and back to keep it mechanically solid.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s the first dry fit of the cabinet frame.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="the-innards">The innards</h3>
<p>My design was for two shelfs to hold a wi-fi router, a 5-port ethernet switch, a Hue hub, a Synology, an outlet extender, and a big ol’ UPS power supply (I have 9 total items to plug in, including some equipment that will be placed on top of the table and on the floor next to this table), but I did not want to see a crapload of cables. So I decided to make an angled back panel to hide the UPS and cabling. Here’s what the inside of each side looked like before the cuts.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The shelf dadoes were easy enough to saw, chisel, and router out, but the angled grooves were a challenge. I couldn’t saw the edges of this groove given the length and angle (at least I couldn’t figure out how to do that), so I slowly and carefully cut out these angled grooves with my hand router. The angled grooves are cut to fit a 1/4 plywood back with some wiggle room (a bit wide).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I used the offcuts from the overhang of the shelfs shown here to use as supports in the back. These thin pieces are used to give me a place to attach ties to keep cables tied nicely up. I liked this solution because there was is no waste and the bars on back will serve a useful function.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s a view of the back to see those offcuts in place.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I decided to use 1/4 plywood for the back angled panel — used mainly to hide cables. So I needed to make holes to pass the cables through. The first attempt at my plywood back failed. I hand chiseled out openings to run cables through. It came out nice, but after I completed it, I tripped after removing it and it snapped in half. Oof. So my second iteration was done using the only power tool in the project: I used a cordless drill and a Forstner bit to cut out six holes to run cables. This was a better solution, overall.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="putting-it-together">Putting it together</h3>
<p>I drilled holes in the top of the cabinet so I could attach walnut dowels to hold the top in place, using the existing openings in the cast iron frame to keep each dowel locked in.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s the dry fit. The medallion on the top shelf you can see below on the top shelf was mounted to the cast iron sewing machine; I was able to delicately remove it and place it here.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A close-up of the medallion, just because I think it’s cool. We lived in Kaiserslautern, Germany, for seven years (where we picked up this sewing machine table at a flea market), so this is a touch of something special for us to see this mounted here. We&rsquo;ve been lugging this table around for about two decades, but never had space for it. I was about to give it away, when this project idea came into mind. I&rsquo;m happy that I found a way to turn it into useful furniture.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I finished the cabinet with Osmo top-oil, because I’m lazy with finishing and like that I can just rub it on, it looks nice, and it dries fast.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The back of the cabinet, showing the slide-in 1/4 panel with holes for cables. I left this panel unglued so I can easily slide it in and out. This was a critical decision, as I aligned the holes so they were hidden behind the shelves, and a few of the cables I had to fit through were too fat to get past the shelves, so this made it easy to move it around to get cabling set up. The holes are also good to promote airflow, I figure, as well as the open top. I also may someday need to add more holes, so now that’s easy to do.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="finished-build">Finished build</h3>
<p>Here’s what it looked like in place, without anything in it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And here is the back that goes against a wall, with all the cabling hooked up. It ain’t pretty, but I don’t have to look at any of this, it’s all nicely hidden behind the panel.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And here is the finished piece in place and in use with all the gear hooked up and running. There are only two visible cables: (1) the power plugged into the wall that goes to the big UPS and a black ethernet cable that runs to my desktop computer so I can be hardwired. The ONT for my new fiber network enters the house and is mounted on the wall directly behind the sewing machine table. The cast iron well where the sewing machine was mounted on the top of the table is covered by the printer, but it’s holding a hidden Anker 5-port USB hub with the cables poking out behind the printer for charging various things. The shredder and a corner light behind the shredder on the floor, along with a HomePod on the desktop, are also all connected up here behind the table without any visible cables. I’m pleased with how it turned out.</p>

			 <p>I am embarking on a quest of sorts to &ldquo;recycle&rdquo; an old sewing machine table I&rsquo;ve carted around from move to move and held in storage for something like 15 years. My goal is to turn it into a hub in my computer room to store a UPS, a laser printer, a Synology, several hubs, a modem, a router, a 5-port switch &hellip; While tastefully arranging lots and lots of cables and power cords and allowing for good air flow. This will sit next to my computer desk at the point where I&rsquo;m having fiber installed in a couple of weeks, so I&rsquo;ll be able to hardwire my computer and keep all the associated network and associated gear neatly in place next to it.</p>
<p>Not sure how this is going to turn out, I&rsquo;m designing it on the fly and relying on a sketch. Today, I got things started.</p>
<p>I began by disassembling the sewing machine table, which was quite an effort. I&rsquo;m keeping the parts I don&rsquo;t use in the hopes that I can use them elsewhere. There is some very interesting hardware here that I&rsquo;m certain I find a use for in future projects. I&rsquo;m thinking of mounting the foot pedal as part of the back cabinet &ldquo;wall&rdquo; for air flow, maybe to route some cables, and because I think it will look cool.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The first step is to create a lower bar to hold the eventual shelf that is going to be housed inside the iron frame. This is a scrap of bubinga. I will hold this in place with two dowels inserted into the lower screw holes of the iron frame.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The next step is to make the dowels. I&rsquo;m using walnut here, pounded through a 1/2 inch dowel jig. Turns out 1/2 was a bit too large so I had to shave them down to a proper millimeter size to fit the screw holes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next, I drilled holes in each end of the bubinga bar to house the dowels.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here&rsquo;s what it looks like rough assembled.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here&rsquo;s a front view. The cabinet I&rsquo;m going to build will be mounted on this bubinga bar at the bottom. At the top, the cabinet will be held in the frame by two wedged tenons.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next up I needed to join two 8 foot lengths of sapele so I have boards wide enough for the project. This is an image of joining the edges.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And I glued them up so I&rsquo;m ready to start cutting out the cabinet pieces tomorrow.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I sketched out a rough plan. I think this is the right kind of project to sketch out the basic idea but figure out the finer details as I go along. This sketch shows a side and front view. The cabinet will taper to fit the shape of the table. One thing I haven&rsquo;t figured out: I want the UPS to sit on a shelf that faces the back wall. No idea how I&rsquo;m going to do that at this point.</p>

			 <p>I finished up a gift pencil box for a friend. I have a bunch of lapel pins that I use for these projects. I cut off the back of the pin and then carve out a place to inset the pin into the box. Makes for a nice keepsake.</p>
<p>For this project, I used wenge for the sides and walnut for the bottom. I challenged myself to cut the smallest dovetails I’ve ever attempted and it was indeed a challenge. I almost scrapped this project to start over because I had so many problems. This is the completed box from the front:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And from the top, showing the walnut bottom:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was originally going to make a sliding lid for this project, but that didn’t work out. I cut grooves for lid, but I cut them too close to the top of the box, so the top edge split the first time I tried to slide in a lid. So I improvised and shaved off the top grove to make it an open box. For the box top corners, I used a chisel to make little bevel edges so it looks like I planned it that way. I also had a heck of a time with the tiny dovetails. When I started this, I was thinking “I wonder how small I can go with dovetails?” Well, this is apparently as small as I can go with my experience level.</p>
<p>A few items of note for this project:</p>
<p>I used a Raamtang vise made many years ago. As I do many smaller projects, I find myself turning to this tabletop vise quite often. It’s a very useful appliance.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Planing the thin pieces took some creative work holding on my Nicholson bench.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is the setup I used to mark the tails. The hardest part about working with this wood: I could not see the lines, the wood is so dark.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When I was cutting the dovetails to the line, I used blue tape to mark where to stop since I had so much trouble seeing my lines. I used a Dozuki saw to cut the dovetails and it worked very well. I think I prefer using this saw over my western dovetail saw.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A few holidays ago, I got this set of very tiny little chisels because my wife thought they were cute. I’ve never had occasion to use them until now! I felt ridiculous, but I couldn’t otherwise get at some of the places with my smallest regular-sized chisel.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Fun project, but looking forward to the large bookshelf I&rsquo;ll be building next.</p>

			 <p>Working on a project to build a couple of utility room shelves using big box store poplar, which is proving to be a fun hand tool challenge. The top shelf is joined with dovetails, the bottom shelf ends are 3/8&quot; dados with through-tenons that will have cherry wedges. Tools used: rip saw, carcase saw, router plane, chisels, and a swing brace. #woodworking #handtools</p>

<p>Interesting idea showcased in this article from The Verge: an upcoming Angry Miao mechanical keyboard that adds a capacitive touchpad to use for arrow movement or other functions.</p>
<p>I use an <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com">ErgoDox EZ</a> split keyboard that has no arrow keys. I find that placing the arrow keys on another layer works fine with practice. However, I still prefer to have arrow keys visible and easy to access.

It&rsquo;s interesting to look back at my old blog post, in which I cite IBM&rsquo;s Watson, in light of where we are today with AI.

			 <p>The <a href="https://linkingmanifesto.org">Manifesto for Ubiquitous Linking</a> debuted at the end of 2021, but I just learned of it today. I&rsquo;ll post the entire thing here, as the manifesto requires: &ldquo;This declaration may be freely copied in any form, but only in its entirety, including this notice.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recognize that an immense amount of useful information is available digitally, and that tremendous value can be gained by connecting this information. Connected knowledge enables people to create great products, solve important problems and improve themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We also recognize that humans work best in psychological flow. Switching contexts, even to search for information, interferes with flow while consuming precious mental capacity, brain energy and time. Activating an aptly-placed link to information is easier and faster than searching for the information — and more protective of flow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We affirm that the ability to copy a link to a resource is as important for cognitive productivity as the ability to copy other types of information. This applies to all persistent digital information.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We invite software developers to do their part, by</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>ensuring their users can conveniently obtain a link to the currently open or selected resource via a user interface; and</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>providing an application programming interface (API) to obtain or construct a link to that resource (i.e., to get its address and name).
To help people benefit from the information they process with software, we advocate ubiquitous support for linking of information resources. This would help realize the potential of hypermedia that was envisioned by information technology pioneers such as Ted Nelson and Douglas Englebart.</li>
</ol>
<p>A good goal and, fortunately for me, most of the apps I use are <a href="https://hookproductivity.com/what-mac-apps-are-compatible-with-hook-app">link-friendly</a>.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://tidbits.com/2021/12/06/well-known-apple-developers-support-manifesto-for-ubiquitous-linking/">Adam Engst of Tidbits</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind, this is a manifesto, not a technology, standard, spec, or product. The Manifesto for Ubiquitous Linking is meant to encourage developers to add linking capabilities to their apps such that every distinct information resource within the app can be accessed via a link. And it encourages users who want to reap the cognitive benefits to request such support from the developers of the apps they use.</p>

			 <p>This one is odd, but it serves a purpose. We have an elderly cat who has bad joints so has trouble eating. I set out to create an adjustable tray so he didn’t have to bend down to eat. Here&rsquo;s what I came up with. I made it tall enough to plan for the future (in case we end up getting a really large cat or a small dog someday in the future). Our cat can now comfortably eat while seated. The trays easily move up or down depending on the size of the bowl.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The inspiration for this: I had two Harbor Freight bar clamps in my shop, shown below, which I never use because I don’t like to use them for work holding. But the one thing I like about these is that the bottom clamp ratchet is very easy to move up and down. So I thought, what if I cut these clamps up and used the parts to make a cat feeder that could be adjusted?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is the end result, with a touch of decorative cord wrapping. This was all made with wood scraps and it’s mostly poplar. I’m happy with how it came out and I believe it a one-of-kind design. I mean, really who is going to make something this weird?</p>
<p>Each tray is attached with four screws (and glued) to the aluminum clamp ratchets. I framed the trays so each has a lip so the cat can’t push the bowl off the edge.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I added bumper feet on the bottom of the stand to keep it off the ground a bit in case a water bowl is tipped. I made the top removable so each tray can be removed and cleaned. The tops are capped with scrap leather just to ensure we don’t cut ourselves on the cut aluminum edges. Each bar is set in the poplar base with deep mortises, glued, and screwed in. Also, I added wood inserts to the inner part of the bars for more sturdiness.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The top is shaped so it’s easy to lift off. I cut tiny mortises to fit these bits from the bar clamps and they just rest on top of the aluminum arms. I glued them in.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And here is the final. The apparatus is sized to fit nicely on a standard cat mat. I finished all the wood parts with three coats of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Osmo TopOil High Solid<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I decided to try my hand at making a small Kumiko ornament for the tree, as a first step in learning this process for later larger projects. This one took way more time than expected, because I needed to first create the jigs to cut tiny Kumiko strips. I figured out what I needed to do with an excellent book, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shoji and Kumiko Design: Book 1 The Basics by Desmond King<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and very helpful <!-- raw HTML omitted -->YouTube videos from Adrian Preda<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. So I bought a big chunk of 5’‘W x 36’‘L x 1-1/16’’ basswood from Rockler and went to work.  Here&rsquo;s the finished piece.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And here are the basic steps, starting with some pics of getting the basswood cut down to size. I started by cutting the board into thirds.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And then cutting those boards into thirds.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And then resawing all of those thirds.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I used two-sided tape to hold the wood while I cut the small strips out of the resulting boards, after planing them down.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here are the jigs I made, which took the most time in this project by far. The first one in the image below is for cutting the angles needed. I made this design up and I’m proud of it because it is all self-contained and can hang on a wall. You’ll see how it’s used shortly. The second jig is for planing the basswood down to uniform strips of 1/2&quot; by 1/8&quot;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s the planing stop in action. The stop is 1/2&quot; and two inserts are added as needed, one is 1/4&quot; and one is 1/8&quot;. The side piece of MDF is used to cut the strips to length, after removing the inserts. So it does double duty.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s how the angle-cutting jig works. The two short pieces of hard maple can be flipped around so each has two angles available. These fit into the jig with an adjustable stop for longer pieces. I hope to make larger Kumiko projects later on, so this gives flexibility. I can just cut new maple blocks if I need other angles to make other Kumiko patterns.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And here is my first Kumiko pattern (in the classic asa-no-ha shape). It is not perfect, but I’m happy how it turned out. I stuck it in the Christmas tree. Next year, I aim to batch produce a number of these for gifts. It was fun to learn how these work and was a challenge for hand tools only. Learning to do this with buttery basswood is a good way to go. I may next try one with walnut.</p>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s a project using scrap walnut tongue-and-groove boards I was given by friend, which I used to create a small tray to dry herbs — my wife does a lot with herbal tinctures and such and needed a rack to dry some of the plants and mushrooms she collects while foraging.</p>
<p>This is the final drying rack:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The biggest challenge in creating this was the small size. Here is the walnut board I started with:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I used a holding tool I previously made called a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Raamtang<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to keep all the small bits held firmly while I worked on them. This small wooden vise has proven invaluable over the years and is worth the time and effort to build if you create a lot of smaller projects.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I decided to make this a simple mitered box, but will add splines for strength. I cut the angles free hand and then dialed them in with this 45 degree shooting board I made. The final pieces are shown here resting on top of the shooting board.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I added a fancy curve to the four edges of the tray. I drew the curve on paper then traced it onto the wood. I used a backsaw to cut the to lines of the curve.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then used a coping saw to get near my lines.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then cleaned it all up with files and a spokeshave.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here are the final curved edges.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After glueing up the frame, I added the splines with a contrasting wood (scraps of oak). I cut out the corners, cut the splines, then planed them flush with a block plane.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then the final step was adding the chicken wire, for which I used some mesh from a big box store. The wire mesh is attached to the underside of the frame with wood strips half-lapped, glued and strengthened with small screws. That&rsquo;s it.</p>

			 <p>A short article in the September/October 2021 issue of Popular Woodworking called attention to retired <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pattern maker<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bill Martley&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> project to reproduce the bronze head of the classic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Studley Mallet<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, named after Henry O. Studley (1838-1925) that many woodworkers know from his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->famous and mind-blowing tool chest<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>A member of my woodworking group spotted this article and suggested we embark on a group build. The bronze casting for the mallet cost $69 with shipping included. What an amazing opportunity and bargain! I received my bronze mallet head in the mail a couple of weeks ago and here&rsquo;s the mallet I made with it using bubinga, bocote wedges, and a handle with inset waxed cord. I just love how this came out and I&rsquo;m so grateful that Martley made this possible.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the mallet I made with the casting:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And I&rsquo;ll briefly document the steps I took to make it.</p>
<p>First off, here&rsquo;s the bronze casting as it arrived in the mail, along with the wood I selected to make the infill and handle. I went with bubinga.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here&rsquo;s the infill block sized to fit through the hole in the bronze head.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next I chop out the through-mortise to match up with the hole where the handle will fit.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here&rsquo;s a view of the wooden insert with the mortise completed, mostly to show what the top and bottom of the casting looked like before I polished it up.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now I began to shape handle, drawing out what I wanted in pencil.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here&rsquo;s a view of the handle, where I&rsquo;ve cut out the slot to fit into the bronze casting. I used my large tenon saw for this. I squared it all up with chisels.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here it is all rough fit together. Looking like a mallet now.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next, I shined it all up using a Dremel. Wow, what a difference. I left it rough, because I liked the look of it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now, onto the handle. I cut it out roughly with saw work, then filed down with my beloved <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Auriou rasps<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the handle, showing the cuts for the wedged tenons that&rsquo;ll go in the top to splay the wood out and hold it firm. The infill wood has not yet been cut to length.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next, I decided to go with a wax cord wrap for the handle. I wanted it to sit flush, so I chiseled out the beginning and the end so it slopes inward from each side, so when I wrap the cord it&rsquo;ll gently slope upward. This will form a nice place to hold it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This image shows the beginning of the cord wrap, using tape to hold the ends in place. I wrapped the cord so tight, my hands cramped up.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And here a few glamour shots of the completed mallet, which I finished with boiled linseed oil. Oh, and I forgot to mention, I&rsquo;ve added the wedges here. The two top wedges are tiny slices of bocote, which I think contrasts nicely with the bubinga. It was a fun project, and now I have a small mallet with a lot of mass. It&rsquo;ll be a useful shop tool that I hope will still be in use by someone long after I&rsquo;m gone.</p>

<p>The small bench is complete. We&rsquo;re going to use this for putting on / taking off shoes in the mudroom. It&rsquo;s been an interesting hand tool project, and I&rsquo;m happy with how it came out. The main issues I had with assembly were some small joinery gaps, but I fixed these with hide glue and matching sawdust, and those gaps are not noticeable in the end. I have to say I’m not crazy with the sapele choice for the aprons, in retrospect. In the right light, the sapele looks kind of orange, so I think that’s what is bugging me. But it will mellow with time and I think it will age nicely.</p>
<p>I’m really happy with how the grain shows in the walnut, and the top of the bench really in particular shows some interesting light/dark contrasts with strong gray streaks. I also added a slight bow to each long side of the bench top, which gives the top a gentle tapered (subtle) curve at each end. I finished it with Osmo Polyx-Oil.</p>
<p>Here are some final assembly shots:</p>
<p>Here’s a shot documenting the tenon cuts for the legs.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And the mortises for the bench top.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I tapered the legs on the inside to help give the bench a slimmer profile from the front.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I locked in the knots on the bench top with some 5-min epoxy and it worked well. Since I just needed a little bit, I used the epoxy that I use for fly tying. I did this so that the knots don&rsquo;t crumble over time.</p>

			 <p>Making progress on the walnut bench. I&rsquo;ve cut most of the mortise and tenons to connect up the legs. I&rsquo;m using sapele for the aprons. This is the rough cut of the aprons using my rip and crosscut handsaws.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This image shows all of the markup for the tenons. I mark the lines deeply with a wheel marking gauge and then trace the lines with a pencil so they are easy to see.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And here are the cut tenons … couple of hours later. I used a carcase saw to first cut the cheeks, then cut the tenons out. Afterwards, cleaned up with chisels to ensure the lines were straight.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then I started on the mortises. I marked it up so that the aprons will be flush with the edge of the walnut legs. The hand drill is used to cut out most of the tenon waste, then chisels to clean them out and square the edges.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And … an hour or two later, all the mortises are cut in the legs.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s the dry fit of the bench, but the top is just sitting on top. In other words, I haven’t yet cut the mortise/tenons to attach the top.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next, I moved on to the front/back apron design. I decided to go for a big wide curve. To create that curve, I attached a string and pencil to my shop bents, then moved it to the right distance to get the desired arc. It took some trial and error (need to hold the pencil straight and taut) but it worked well. As you can see, I dressed up for the photo shoot to document the work.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next, I decided to create a nice profile so it wasn’t just a plain curve. I marked out proportions that looked nice to me by marking up three 10mm sections with two 5mm steps, and then using the base of a marking gauge to draw some circles until I liked the look of it. While I typically use English units, I often switch to metric for mark up for things like this because for me it’s just easier.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I started out using my bow saw, but I soon decided to saw to the line in segments across the curve just to help get rid of waste as I cut with the bow saw; cutting out little sections makes it easier for me, at least psychologically.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s what that looked like about halfway through:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After it was roughed out, I started getting closer to the line with a spokeshave. Once I was happy with that, I moved on the fancy profile.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There may be better ways to do this, but this works for me. I cut down to my lines with my carcase saw and then use my files to finish the job. Here’s the before:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And the after:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And the following is the front apron all finished up. Next, I need to do this for the back apron so it matches. I think I’ll just leave the short side sapele aprons as they are (squared off), but I want the front and back to match, even though the back of the bench will be against a wall (it’s going to be a bench for the mudroom to put on shoes). It may not always be used in this fashion, so it should look good from any angle. It&rsquo;s getting close to completion!</p>

			 <p>My wife asked if I could make an extra-long shoehorn because she’s having some knee trouble. So I knocked out this project in an evening and it was a lot of fun.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I grabbed a scrap of cherry and roughly cut it to size using a rip saw and a spokeshave. Then it was mostly an exercise in filing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I had a small shoehorn (store bought) to use as a reference. It occurred to me that this is kind of like spoon carving, but easier because there is no “front spoon edge” (so to speak) to a shoe horn, so I could just file it right down to get the desired shape. I had my significant other test it out several times to ensure I got the shape just right. The hardest part was ensuring it was as thin as possible at the edges of the &ldquo;spoon,&rdquo; but still strong.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I shaped the handle with block plane.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And finished it off with some Osmo wood wax, then wrapped the handle with blue waxed cord. I also added a loop to the end to hang it up out of the way. The lovely cherry wood grain was a happy accident. I had no idea that beautiful grain was hidden in that scrap of wood.</p>

<p>I have never worked with wood that is this funky, so it’s going to be a challenge to flatten them. So far, I have cut each to length, getting rid of the worst (most warped) parts of each slab. I have started flattening one of them. It’s going to take time, clearly.</p>
<p>I started with a scrub plane to get rid of the worst of the peaks:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And moved on to a #6 fore plane:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That&rsquo;s as far as I got this evening. Time to sharpen blades before I continue. I plan to have two flattened boards and a plan to make a bench within the next couple of days.  Details are still being worked out.</p>

<p>I started with a small slab of Koa. It&rsquo;s a special plane, so I decided to use some of the special wood I had bought when I had lived in Hawaii. I printed out the plan for the plane body at actual size and traced it out. I placed the plane blade here so I could better visualize what I was doing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what it looks like all penciled out.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I cut out part of the body with a Carcase saw and my bow saw. Then came the scary part: carefully drilling out the holes for the special screws (forget the name of these) that would hold the blade in place.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You have to drill two holes on each side so that these screws sit flush. Not easy to do with with a hand drill, I discovered.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here&rsquo;s a View of cutting the inside handle hold with my bow saw.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And then some heavy and tedious filing to get everything down to the lines and smoothed out.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The threads in the plane body and the threads for the bolts are created with a thread cutter.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And here is how the screws are made for the arms. I used walnut because it&rsquo;s pretty easy to work with, relatively speaking.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Rough cut for each wooden bolt. Then file them out to round them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The completed arms with the bolts. These fit into the plane body like so, using the threads I created.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The most terrifying part of the plane build was cutting the kerf to fit the blade. It had to be perfect, so I created a jig to guide my saw and went really, really slow.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So I created this fence for the plane and glued it up, then realized I had made a terrible mistake. It&rsquo;s way too thick. It needs to rest against the blade, but this fence hits the plane body and was a total fail. Not sure how I got to this point, but there it is. So what to do?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I could have started all over with the plane fence, but I decided to salvage it. So that&rsquo;s why you see these interesting light colored things that look like joints that don&rsquo;t joint anything. I installed a proper smaller fence arm. I tried to make the mistake look like a feature and not a bug. Here, you can see the blade is installed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A view of the final plane from the another angle.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here it is in action, cutting the kerf on a board that I&rsquo;m going to resew with the frame saw. The wooden bolts lock the fence in place to get the desired line.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And that kerf gives you a good line all around the board to help keep the frame saw cutting true.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The result is resawed boards that are far better than I&rsquo;d get than without using the Kerfing Plane.</p>

			 <p>Here’s a small project designed to hold a utility knife, presented as a going-away gift for a work colleague. It’s the smallest box I’ve ever made and was an interesting challenge.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s the documentation:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I started with some ¼ inch walnut I had leftover from other projects. I used my combination plane to rabbit an edge, which will hold the base and the lid.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I cut the pieces to size with my carcass saw and then squared up the cut edges.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The dimensioning was all done by sight, using the knife case as a guide.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While I used the combo plane where I could, I still ended up doing a lot of fine chiseling, especially on the crossgrain little pieces.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Using the combo plane on such a small piece was a real challenge for figuring out how to hold the work. Here, I use the birds mouth and holdfasts.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here are all the sides of the box. I didn’t do any fancy joinery, just rabbets and grooves.</p>
<p>The sliding lid of the box has an inset NOAA pin, where we work. This is a lapel pin, so I snipped off the back and removed the frog.</p>
<p>Creating the inset hole for the pin was a slow process, using carving tools and a ¼ chisel. I used a similar process to create a small thumb-sized divet on the other side of the box lid.</p>
<p>The glue up. Again, this is just grooves and rabbets. I figured it was a display box and wouldn’t be subjected to a lot of stress, so the glue would be adequate.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here is the final box. The lid slides out. I tried to keep it a bit tight on the lid so there was a bit of tension, and then waxed the inside grooves. The walnut box is finished off with Osmo. Some of the edges are a bit rough, but I thought that was OK as it matches the rustic or rugged feel of a box that holds a utility knife.</p>

<p>So I needed a new shooting board. My old one was created over a year ago and I skimped and made the fence with douglas fir, which didn&rsquo;t hold up well at all. Plus, it just wasn&rsquo;t that well constructed and I wasn&rsquo;t able to get great results with it. As I&rsquo;m about to start a project which will require lots of shooting, I decided to do this now.</p>
<p>So I did a search for &ldquo;shooting board designs&rdquo; and came across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this one<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is a plan I didn&rsquo;t purchase (but the photo on the page was enough to inspire me). I made the base with good plywood and the fences with hickory lined with wenge. The guide is also wenge. I choose hickory because I have a lot of it left over from my bow saw project. I choose wenge, because when I visited the Lie-Nielsen shop and saw their demo shooting board, it had wenge incorporated in it, and the person working there told me that wenge is a good choice because it stays true. That was enough to convince me, and I happen to have wenge.</p>
<p>I thought I was going to have buy some parts to make a detachable miter fence, but then it occured to me that I already have a couple of featherboards for a router table that I NEVER use, so I could steal the hardware from that and use it for my project. By chance, I already had a couple of longer carriage bolts that fit perfectly:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So here is the completed shooting board without the miter fence:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here it is with the miter fence:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And here it is on edge, in storage position (added a groove in the front to snuggly hold the miter bits.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I did some test cuts today and it&rsquo;s great. I&rsquo;m quite happy with it. One thing about it: the board is smallish. Not a big deal for squaring an edge with long pieces because it&rsquo;s easy to stick in some support on the bench. But when shooting miters on longer boards, the ends are going to hanging in the air of the table. So the way I&rsquo;m dealing with that is with my shop bent. I didn&rsquo;t glue up the top piece in my bent so it can be removed:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The &ldquo;standard&rdquo; height of it lines up with my bench top, but I can swap it out for different heights. So now I just need to make a new top piece that is a few inches taller for when I need to support longer pieces for miter cuts. As an aside, I made the bent this way because my other small bench in the shop is a different height, so I have a top part that matches the height of that for those times I need to support things on that surface.</p>

<p>I finished my large panel gauge project. It&rsquo;s the first build I&rsquo;ve done that incorporates other-than-wood materials (in this case, lots of brass). I cut the boom arm and body of the gauge out of a giant chunk of 8/4 bubinga. I cut two arms and two bodies so I have the parts ready to go to also make a smaller version later.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had some issues with tear out on the boom arms, but a card scraper got me the rest of the way. Moral of the story here is that I need to do better at taking the time to sharpen my hand planes.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For this build, the boom arm slides through the body via a deep mortise. I decided to drill out as much waste as possible for the mortise, but ended up drilling the holes too close together and had a situation where the outer holes didn’t hold and “collapsed” back in to the previous holes I had cut. This meant I had to chop out quite a bit, so I ended up using a mortise chisel in addition to paring chisels to get it to the lines.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Still, the ending mortise came out crisp and fit the boom arm well.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Next up, I had to shape the head of the gauge to not only look nice, but to shave off some waste to cut the weight down while also shaping to fit my hand. This provided me the first opportunity to use my new bow saw to cut the curves out for the body. I used a French curve to get a shape I liked.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> I smoothed it with rasps and card scrapers. Then used a tap to cut out a screw hole in the wood to fit a brass screw. This screw tightly holds the boom arm at different lengths. The brass screw I had was a bit long so I shortened it with the hack saw. Also shown here: a brass fence on the underside of the gauge to register against the wood I&rsquo;m marking. This is held in place with three brass screws fit flush by countersinking holes in the brass.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I finished it with Osmo poly-wax. And here it is. One other detail I haven&rsquo;t mentioned: I installed a 1/4&quot; brass bar in the boom arm so that the screw can tighten on it without damaging the wood.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> On one end of the boom arm, I drilled a hole to fit a pencil. On the other end, I capped it with a small brass bar that serves to hold a marking knife. So I can use either side depending on my needs.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One thing that I discovered during this build is that a card scraper works great on brass. My brass bar on the boom arm was a bit proud, so I scraped it right down with little effort. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the brass screws are so soft that you have to first set with regular screws and then take those out and swap in the brass. And that&rsquo;s it. This project is another step in Semester One of the great <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hand Tool School run by Shannon Rogers<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Joining up with Shannon&rsquo;s Apprenticeship program has transformed my woodworking. Going on my second year and I&rsquo;m finally almost done with the first semester.</p>

			 <p>I now have a bow saw. This was a fun weekend project that involved only two mortise/tenon joints and drilling two 1/4&quot; holes.

<p>I have a new fly tying box. The aspect of this that I&rsquo;m most proud of is that it was made with handtools from start to finish, with one small exception which I&rsquo;ll detail below. It took about two months from start to finish, working on nights and weekends. I created this because I often tie flies away from home and I wanted a case that was easy to carry and also contained all the essential hardware. I also wanted a box that quickly converts to a tying station.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the finished product. I used about $50 of hardware from Rockler for the handle and the catches. The box is walnut, lined with cork on the bottom. The top is framed by walnut with cherry in the middle. Here&rsquo;s the front:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s the back:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And here it is opened up. The raised L-shaped arm on the underside of the top is the tying station. There is also a swing-out arm with hand-made dowels to store/use 12 extra bobbins of thread, tinsel, wire, etc. The last &ldquo;dowel&rdquo; that you see in the front is made of metal. This metal dowel matches up with a rare-earth magnet on the underside of the base so it stays secured when swung in for storage.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s the tying station set up for use with the tying vise in place, tools places in the holes in the L-shaped arm, and bobbins stacked on the swing-out holder. I also carved in three concave holes in the cherry base to hold various small tying items, and embedded a strong, long magnet on the insides across the front of the cherry base so that hooks are caught from falling on the floor. Lastly, I cut a shallow groove between the concave holders in back and the magnet in front so that if anything non-magnetic rolls (non-metal beads, mostly), they&rsquo;ll settle in the middle of the station and not roll onto the floor.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s a walk-through of how it was made.</p>
<p>I started out with a bunch of walnut tongue and groove boards I was given by a neighbor. I had a rough piece of cherry also, not pictured here.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I then drew up a rough plan of what I wanted. I set outside dimensions and the height of the box (it had to be big enough to hold all my stuff and tall enough to store and mount my vise), but I didn&rsquo;t use a ruler to measure out anything else for the box. I  based every other cut by referencing from other parts.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The hardest (manual) work in creating the box was resawing all the stock with my rip saw and planing it down to final dimensions.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The bottom panel was glued up with hide glue (I used hide glue for the entire project).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then I cut all the dovetails for the box frame and the grooves to house the bottom panel.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s the box in the process of being dry fit.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And here&rsquo;s the interior of the box all fit together, complete with the inner carrying compartment. The small compartment is sized to hold the fly tying vise clamp. The odd U-shaped bit and hole on the right side is custom-sized so that it perfectly fits my vise. The rest of the area is for tool storage. The outside L-shape is where the tying base mounted to the box top fits in for storage.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then I lined the bottom with cork.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The next image shows how much the storage compartment holds: the vise, the vise clamp, all my tools, and a bunch of extra stuff depending on what I might need for a particular session.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next, I started on the top of the box: walnut frame with mortises/tenons and a cherry panel.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here is the top completed, exploded view.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Here&rsquo;s the one spot where I had to use a power tool: a table saw. I needed to cut out a really big space to hold the hidden magnet, but it had to cut in a way that the top was really thin so that the magnet had enough strength through the wood to hold hooks and other metal objects on the base. I didn&rsquo;t try to do this by hand with such small margins. So I used the table saw to cut a deep groove, then used a 1/4&quot; mortise to square up the hole so I could fit the magnet.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After the top was completed, I then started working on the L-shaped tying station that mounts into the top. I used a Raamtang vise I made, ideal for holding small parts for shaping and planing down.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->here&rsquo;s the L-shaped tying station top, the bobbin holder, and the arms to attach it to the base with the mortises cut out.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I cut out the dowel for the corner arm and the tiny dowels for the bobbin holder using a dowel maker from Lie-Nielsen.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also had to cut in a groove where the clamp fits on the tying station because I made it just a tad to short and there wasn&rsquo;t enough space to tighten the clamp. So this solved that small error.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I finished it all up with Osmo polyx-oil.

<p>With Unclutter, it&rsquo;s really easy to create new notes on the fly.

It&rsquo;s fast and I don&rsquo;t need to first open an app. As an aside, Unclutter presents three panes: one holds clipboard items, one stores files, and one is for jotting down quick notes. It&rsquo;s very handy. But this post is just about the notes pane, which I tend to use the majority of the time.</p>
<p>And the majority of the time, I&rsquo;m typing in notes that I only need to maintain for a short time. Say, for instance, when I&rsquo;m on a call and want to quickly log some notes. Those notes remain within Unclutter until I&rsquo;m done with them, then I delete them.</p>
<p>But on occasion, I want a new note to be copied over to the Bear app. Bear is where I hold longer-term notes. Here&rsquo;s a very easy way to do that using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hazel<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a brilliant Mac automation tool.</p>
<p>When I create a note in Unclutter that I want to save in Bear, I add a tag. In my case, I call it #.inbox/unclutter. In Bear tagging structure parlance, this means that I want this note to be in my inbox (#.inbox) with the sub-tag of unclutter. This works similar to traditional folders: the note will appear nested in my inbox tag. The &lsquo;.&rsquo; in front of my inbox tag ensures that this frequently-accessed tag is sorted (alphabetically) near the top of my list of tags, which is handy since the &ldquo;inbox&rdquo; is always where I start when I fire up Bear. It&rsquo;s where I store items to be further processed. So here&rsquo;s a note I created in Unclutter (using markdown) with the ending tag: #.inbox/unclutter:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In Hazel, I created a rule to scan for texts in the Dropbox folder where Unclutter notes are stored. That rule searches for the tag: #.inbox/unclutter. When it sees that tag, it automatically copies the text note into Bear. Here&rsquo;s what that rule looks like:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And once the Hazel rule runs, my new Unclutter note is copied into Bear.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Why do I want to do this? I&rsquo;m generally using Unclutter as a really fast way to jot down notes. For most of those notes, I don&rsquo;t want to save them for posterity. They&rsquo;re just quick single entries for when I need to get some text down with no fuss, without needing to open an app. But sometimes I create a note with content that I intend to either build upon in the future, or want to copy/move to another text note housed within the Bear app. For those notes that I want to save for the longterm, I add just add the tag at the end and it&rsquo;s waiting for me in Bear.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a small project to replace a handle on a Chinese-style ladle. The handle I had to replace was a cheap bit of pine pushed in to the metal part of the ladle. Instead of trying to replicate that, I decided to make a handle that would house the ladle. So I grabbed a scrap of walnut, cut it down to size with my rip saw, and then scratched my head for a while figuring out how to secure it.</p>
<p>My solution was to first drill the hole that would house the ladle. I locked it in my vise and used a brace I recently picked up for a few bucks to drill the hole. I also got an auger file recently and had just sharpened up some bits I had also picked up at the local flea market &hellip; so I was eager to try it out. It worked surprisingly well.</p>
<p>Then I took a length of 3/4&quot; oak dowel and used a spokeshave to shave it down a bit so I could mount the new handle on the face of my workbench to work on it. I shaped the handle with spokeshave, chisels, and a file.</p>
<p>This is the handle in rough form mounted on a dowel. I used a chisel to slim it down.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then I worked on it with the spokeshave.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I tapered it with the spokeshave, then smoothed out the rough edges with a file and chamfered the edges with a chisel. I finished it off with some flexible sand paper.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And here it is attached the to ladle.</p>

<p>I recently completed a new vise <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moxon benchtop vise<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The hardware and a good portion of the design inspiration is from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tools for Working Wood<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s hard maple, 23&quot; between the screws, cork lined, and finished with Danish oil. It was made with hand tools only, as part of my online apprenticeship with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hand Tool School<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The holes in the front and back jaw were easy to drill, but the right side was just a tad off when I put the screws in and tested the alignment and it was causing it to stick. So the second shot is a dowel with sandpaper I used to open up the rear jaw hole just a bit so there was no rubbing or sticking on the wood.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here are the mortises on the underside of the vise that house the nuts. These were chopped out, of course, with mortise chisels.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since I didn&rsquo;t own a rabbet plane when I made this, I used a saw to cut the top and bottom rabbets. This took forever. I had to a lot of clean up work with the router plane to them square.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I made a 45 degree guide for the cut, but it was only really useful to eyeball things to ensure I was at the same angle all the way across. Since I wanted a lip at the top of the front jaw, I couldn&rsquo;t cut all the way to the angle guide in the back and it was too much of a hassle to get the guide at the right height in back to match up with cut I was making. So I really just relied on cutting down to the top and bottom lines marking the angle on the front jaw. Then I just planed it down. I figured I didn&rsquo;t really care if it was exactly 45 degrees, anyways&hellip;as long as it was uniform and about 45 degrees, I was good. The angle is there so there&rsquo;s room to angle saw cuts without cutting into the vise wood.</p>

<p>The above video was the scene across the street from our house a few days ago.

The impressive part of it was the deafening noise they made on an otherwise quiet morning.</p>
<p>While starlings may be a scourge to many a birder, they are certainly interesting.

<p>Starlings in North America have an interesting backstory. Here&rsquo;s the story, sourced from iBird Pro: one hundred of these non-native birds were released in Central Park in 1890 by an industrialist intent on establishing a U.S. home for all birds mentioned in the works of Shakespeare. Now there are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->200 million<!-- raw HTML omitted --> starlings roaming the countryside.</p>

They&rsquo;re all good, each with different strengths. iBird Pro is the most popular and offers a lot of depth, but the UI tends toward the cluttered and confusing; in contrast, Peterson Birds offers a fantastic UI for quickly identifying birds and has outstanding illustrations; Audubon Birds is somewhere in between in terms of UI, but stands out from the pack with a really cool service called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->eBird<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is an easy way to &lsquo;log&rsquo; bird sightings and to see what species have been spotted by citizen birders near your present location. I hesitate to name one of these apps as the &lsquo;best.&rsquo; If you enjoy birding, my advice is to wait for app sales and get all of them (I picked up two of these apps for .99 cents).</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Last December, my wife came across an ad on Craigslist for free fieldstone. On a whim, I decided to haul it home to build a wall.

			 <p>Since I&rsquo;m moving into a hotel for a couple of months at the end of this week, I&rsquo;ve been shopping around for a Virtual Private Network.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The type of VPN I&rsquo;m talking about is not the kind that one uses to connect securely to an office network. What I&rsquo;m talking about is a VPN that provides encryption from a PC to a remote VPN service. This type of VPN protects data while the bits are &lsquo;in the air&rsquo; over a public WiFi connection. Once it reaches the VPN company, it&rsquo;s decrypted and sent along to intended destinations via a wired connection. What you get out of this kind of service is, essentially, a greater level of insurance that your internet activity over public WiFi will remain safe and secure.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When I first started looking into this, I found that there&rsquo;s a question of whether or not this is really necessary. I found two categories of opinions in my research. Some people feel that it&rsquo;s generally OK to forego the use of a VPN while engaged in general browsing at a public WiFi hotspot, but it&rsquo;s best to wait until you get home to do anything sensitive involving passwords. Mail is a particular concern here. This camp notes that it&rsquo;s generally safe to engage in password-protected activities <!-- raw HTML omitted -->provided<!-- raw HTML omitted --> you ensure you&rsquo;re on a secure connection (i.e. https). However, this is generally not the safest option. Most of the comments I came across suggest that it&rsquo;s a best practice to use a VPN connection whenever you tap into a public WiFi hotspot (even if you&rsquo;re on a wired hotel connection), and doubly so if you are going to be on said public network for an extended period of time.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m opting for the more secure solution. It&rsquo;s a low-cost security measure. It&rsquo;ll give me peace of mind. But which trusted service should I use?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I started out by trying two free options. The first is the popular <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HotSpot Shield<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This service works as advertised, but I found that it notably decreased my connection speed. It also requires the installation of an application that resides in the menu bar. When it&rsquo;s launched, it fires up an ad-based browser page that is a bit obtrusive, but not too bad. All considered, I concluded that it&rsquo;s a good option if you&rsquo;re looking for an occasional-use VPN while, say, at a coffee shop for a few hours. Hotspot Shield also offers a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->free iPhone VPN option<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. While the iPhone service was very simple to set up, I could not get it to work on my iPhone after trying for several days.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The second free VPN option I tried is called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ItsHidden<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The caveat with this free service is that you&rsquo;re booted off of your connection every 20 minutes. If you don&rsquo;t want to be disconnected after a set period of time, the service offer a pay option for $12.99 a month. There are two things I liked about ItsHidden. First, it requires no software installation. Second, it was a lot speedier than Hotspot Shield. However, I felt uneasy about entrusting my longterm online activity to the service. Their website offers no clues about who they are, where they&rsquo;re located, or how long they&rsquo;ve been in business. And, frankly, it looks like the site was put together in someone&rsquo;s basement. It doesn&rsquo;t inspire confidence. I read in one forum that the main reason this service was set up is to accommodate BitTorrent traffic. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of legit BitTorrent traffic taking advantage of this service, but I couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that it was, well, kind of shady. So I moved on.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I narrowed down my options to two popular pay options from long-established VPN companies.  One is called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WiTopia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The other is called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HotSpotVPN<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Both appear to be great options. The deciding factor in my case was that WiTopia only offered a year subscription, while HotSpotVPN offered month-to-month (and even daily) rates. If you are looking for a long-term relationship, WiTopia is substantially cheaper. They offer one year of 256-bit encrypted SSL service for $60 (in comparison, HotSpotVPN would cost about $138 for a year of 256-bit SSL).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The nice thing about HotSpotVPN—in addition to short-term rates—is that the SSL option offered by the company comes with an additional free PPTP connection, ideal for setting up VPN on an iPhone or iPod Touch. I opted for the cheaper $10.88 month Blowfish 128-bit encryption option after reading in several forums that this amount of encryption, while on the low end of the spectrum of what&rsquo;s available, is more than adequate. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So there you have it. I signed up yesterday. It works great on my Mac and my iPhone. Significantly, I&rsquo;ve found no noticeable speed difference while using it. Setup is quite easy: HotSpotVPN e-mailed me a zipped file with my encryption keys and certification files with easy-to-follow instructions about how to install them in my user Library. They also offered up the option to install <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tunnelblick<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an open source GUI for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OpenVPN<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the Mac (OpenVPN, I&rsquo;ve learned, is used by most consumer VPN services). <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can&rsquo;t comment on Tunnelblick, however, because I didn&rsquo;t install it. I use an alternative paid VPN client called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shimo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for my VPN connections, which I highly recommend. If you&rsquo;re curious as to why I use Shimo, the main reason is that it seamlessly imports Cisco VPN settings (which is what I use for work). If you&rsquo;ve ever used the abysmal Cisco VPN client, you&rsquo;ll understand. Shimo allows me to easily switch between Cisco and, now, my new HotSpotVPN service. I can connect and disconnect from each VPN service in seconds.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One final note: I learned during this process that SSL is generally the best option if you&rsquo;re looking for the fastest solution that will work anywhere. If you decide to use a VPN service whenever you access a public network, SSL is the way to go.</p>

			 <p>Over the past few months, a slew of interesting little tools made the rounds in various tech blogs. I thought I&rsquo;d compile some of the more interesting ones here (and add a few of my personal favorites):<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> f.lux<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This free tool auto-adjusts the color temperature of your display(s) to match the time of day and your lighting source. The night mode is much easier on the eyes. Very pleasant. It can be temporarily disabled for those times when you&rsquo;re engaged in a design project and need full color.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alternative: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nocturne<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (from the developer of QuickSilver) offers &lsquo;night vision mode for your Mac.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s not nearly as subtle and elegant as f.lux, but you can adjust the settings to your liking. It&rsquo;s especially great if you like it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> dark when you&rsquo;re computing at night&hellip;or if you like funky, inverted color schemes.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cinch<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The answer to Windows 7 &lsquo;Snap&rsquo; feature, this $7 tool allows you to instantly resize any open window by dragging it to an edge of your screen. It&rsquo;s particularly great for managing multiple Finder windows on a small laptop screen. I use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PathFinder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (which offers dual pane and tabbed browsing to the Finder) and don&rsquo;t really feel that I have a need for this, but it&rsquo;s a great tool nonetheless. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Readability<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is the only way to read articles on the Web. It removes all the extra formatting, ads, buttons, colors, and other clutter that surrounds a typical Web-based article, leaving only the text you want to read.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I use Readability for articles I want to read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->now<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Instapaper<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for articles I want to read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->later<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my iPhone (using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Instapaper Pro iPhone app<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Choosy<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you&rsquo;re like me and have many installed browsers, this $12 tool is a necessity. It allows you to choose which browser to use when opening an external link or when opening up an HTML file. You can also add other apps to the list. I have Choosy set to prompt me with a pop-up list of all browsers (prioritized with my favorites appearing first in the list), regardless of whether or not the browsers are running. I&rsquo;ve also added MacRabbit&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Espresso<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as a &lsquo;browser&rsquo; to send HTML files direct to this web development tool.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alternative: I haven&rsquo;t tried this one, but you may also want to check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Highbrow<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmmWriter<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A unique tool that&rsquo;s still in Beta (so it&rsquo;s free to try), Ommwriter delivers a full-screen, clutter-free writing environment. This app focuses on setting the mood to foster a creative spirit, offering several nice fonts, a choice of ethereal background sounds, and a variety of subtle keyboard clicking noises that I find annoying (the sounds can be turned off). <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I still prefer the retro simplicity of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WriteRoom<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Hog Bay Software when I need to focus on writing. I use it in combination with Hog Bay&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->QuickCursor<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a wonderful little tool that allows me to edit text from other applications with WriteRoom.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rapportive<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rapportive replaces the ads you normally see in the right-hand sidebar of Gmail with useful information: a profile of the person you&rsquo;re emailing. It only works in Firefox and Chrome right now, but I use it via <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mailplane<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (available in the latest <!-- raw HTML omitted -->preview<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As an aside, if you use Mailplane, you may like the beautifully minimalist <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Helvetimail<!-- raw HTML omitted --> style sheet.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->SecondBar<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This tool places an Apple menu bar on your second monitor. I use it. It works well enough, providing basic menu bar functionality on the extra monitor. It&rsquo;s quite nice to have the bar on both screens, although it doesn&rsquo;t work with all apps (that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s still in early Beta). It&rsquo;s currently free.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quix<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quix is an extensible bookmarklet, billed as &lsquo;command line for your browser.&rsquo; While it takes some time to learn the commands to use with this tool, it&rsquo;s worth the effort. I love it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Skitch<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This tool is certainly not new, but it stands apart as the easiest way to capture and mark up screen shots. I use it all the time and will gladly purchase it if and when it ever comes out of Beta.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feedly<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I use Google Reader to manage my feeds, but don&rsquo;t really like to read feeds with it. Instead, I use Feedly. The more I use this free online service, the more I like it. On my iPhone, I use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Byline<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Since both tools use the same Google Reader account, my feeds are always synced no matter where I choose to peruse them.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Notational Velocity<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In case you haven&rsquo;t heard, the venerable Notational Velocity is back. This free tool is a simple, minimalist note taking app that is lightning fast. It syncs with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Simplenote<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the iPhone. It&rsquo;s still in Beta, but it&rsquo;s performed flawlessly for me so far.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Before I started using NV again (I had used it many years ago), I was using another great tool called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Justnotes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (which is currently free and also syncs with Simplenote). It feels a bit heavier and is a touch slower than NV, but it&rsquo;s still in early Beta. It&rsquo;s certainly worth checking out. Which one you prefer may come down to your personal design tastes. There is one important difference, though, that may help you make a choice: Justnotes installs in the menu bar, while NV resides in the Dock.</p>

			 <p>I just set up <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Wave<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Buzz<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for one of my Gmail accounts.

Every Buzz item can be turned into a conversation (much as in Wave or Friendfeed.) People can comment on your Buzz, comment on your comments, or @ reply you. Sure, it lacks the hyper-cool wiki-style shared editing features (though those perhaps could be added in a future release), but it also lacks the critical flaw that made Wave into more of a &ldquo;concept car&rdquo; than a real product: I don&rsquo;t have to adopt a new tool or build a new social network. It just adds rich new capabilities into the tool and network that I already use.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That&rsquo;s exactly right. I tried to use Google Wave a couple of months ago with several of my friends, but we abandoned it after a few half-hearted sessions. The lack of Gmail integration was a primary factor. It also wasn&rsquo;t very compelling, given that we already used other tools that did similar things. And that&rsquo;s another reason that Buzz is better: it connects to other sites we already use, most notably Google Reader and Twitter.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Following yesterday&rsquo;s Mailplane post, I received the following comment from Mark Munz, the developer of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TextSoap<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (an app I purchased at full price in 2008 and greatly value): <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mailplane’s price for a year’s usage = $0.07/day. I bought it 2+ years ago, so the cost for me has been less than $0.03/day. We’re all on tighter budgets today. That’s fine. You can wait for another promo opportunity to come around. You can list out missing features that would add more value to the package. Both are reasonable responses. But to just publicly devalue a developers efforts like you did is completely unfair. You apparently want an app that cannot be sustained by the developer long term. Honestly, there is nothing worse than public price whining, except maybe price whining about a relatively low price point.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This really gave me pause to think about what I wrote and how I wrote it. After mulling it over, I&rsquo;ve concluded that he&rsquo;s right about the price. If you consider the price of an app based upon daily use, the cost equation looks quite different. And a mail client isn&rsquo;t an occasional-use application. It&rsquo;s something that is used <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all the time<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. So is $25 too much? What I realize now is that this is the wrong question to ask. What I should have asked is if it&rsquo;s worth it to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->me<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to pay the $25 registration fee. This is an entirely different question, and it leads to the next point.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This should be a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo; decision. Not a &lsquo;maybe not now, but I&rsquo;ll keep using it past the expiration&rsquo; decision. I regret that I advocated using the app beyond the trial date. I&rsquo;m going to make a rule for myself to either delete an app or buy it after the trial period. While it&rsquo;s true that one can keep using the scaled-back version of Mailplane past the 30-day trial (which, as I said yesterday, is a classy thing to allow and is not at all common), is it the right thing to do? No, it&rsquo;s really not. The right thing to do is to make a choice at some point within the trial period. If you like it, buy it. If you don&rsquo;t, delete it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One can argue that Mailplane is just a Google front-end, or one can argue that it&rsquo;s a tightly-integrated, feature-full mail app. I think it&rsquo;s somewhere in between right now. The important point is that I had a lengthy trial to check it out, and now I should choose. For me, I think my last post makes it clear that I really like Mailplane. While I may have come across as whiny about the price, I hope my comments didn&rsquo;t come across as a devaluation of the developer&rsquo;s efforts. That was not my intent. I consider myself an ardent supporter of indie Mac developers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Mark said, budgets are tight all around. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot today about the effect of low prices in the iPhone/Touch App store (not to mention the glut of bundle deals over the past few years) on evolving perceptions about what Mac desktop apps should cost. Are we starting to expect to pay only a couple of bucks? Did that play into my thinking about the cost of Mailplane? Perhaps so. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I&rsquo;ve realized is this: if we all start to expect to pay less and less for Mac desktop apps, we may end up in a place where we have very few indie developers left. That would be terrible. As I&rsquo;ve noted before on this blog, indie third-party apps are the best part of using a Mac. And that&rsquo;s another important point about cost that I&rsquo;m going to keep in mind going forward: paying the registration fee is as much about supporting a particular developer as it is about supporting the community.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I went back and looked at the features I like about Mailplane: access to all of my accounts in one place, tight OS integration, easy photo resizing, drag-and-drop support, Address Book integration, signature and snippet storage, and UI tweaks that let me make my Gmail accounts look great. Is this worth $0.07 a day to me? You know, I think it is.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. I&rsquo;ve decided to buy Mailplane. I was wrong. Thanks for the comment, Mark. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>I just upgraded to WordPress 2.9, neglecting beforehand to deactivate my plugins. This is a mistake. If you&rsquo;re using WP.org and install updates manually as I do, ensure you turn your plugins off. Also ensure you take the time to back up your site and your MySQL database. It&rsquo;s worth the extra effort in case anything else goes wrong.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At any rate, after I performed the update, I could see my site but was unable to access wp-admin. The solution: I removed all of my plugins using my FTP client. It loaded without a problem after that. Then I added the plugins back one at a time until I found the offending item. In my case, it was WP Security Scan. I&rsquo;m sure the developer of this plugin will release an update imminently, but it is currently incompatible with the 2.9. Once I removed it, all was well.</p>

			 <p>This may be old news to most readers, but in case you&rsquo;ve missed it, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blacksmith Games<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has organized a holiday giveaway of one iPhone game per day for the month of December. It&rsquo;s called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Appvent Calendar 09<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Some of the games are quite good. Today, for example, you can pick up an excellent well-designed, and beautifully illustrated game called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blimp<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Craneballs Studios (normally $2.99). <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also of note on the App store, Nuance Communications recently released a very impressive spoken word-to-text translation tool called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dragon Dictation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s free for a limited time. I&rsquo;m very impressed with the accuracy of the app. It&rsquo;s produced using the same engine behind the popular (and expensive) desktop clients Dragon Naturally Speaking and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac Dictation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Once you capture your text, you can copy it to the clipboard, email it, or send it as a text message. Note that the app works by ferrying your voice recording to servers at Nuance, hence you need a WiFi or cellular connection. While translation speeds are zippy over WiFi, it&rsquo;s a bit slow on my Edge connection. Of course, it&rsquo;ll be faster on the 3G network. It&rsquo;s definitely worth picking up while it&rsquo;s free.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Last but not least, it&rsquo;s worth your time and effort to monitor price drops and giveaways on the App store this month. There are a ton of one-day-only and limited-time holiday deals hitting the store each day.

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Cultured Code will be officially unveiled at Macworld Expo in one week. Today, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things 1.0 Release Candidate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hit the streets.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this app for a long time now. It feels like it&rsquo;s been in Beta forever. I am grateful that I&rsquo;ve had the chance to use it for free for so long, and now I&rsquo;m ready to plunk some money down.</p>
<p>That Things took so long to reach 1.0 (it was originally slated to come out last Spring) speaks volumes about the care and attention placed into creating this app. If you want to get a sense for how much care and attention we&rsquo;re talking about, check out the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> entries chronicling the development process.</p>
<p>In short, if you&rsquo;ve never used it, try it out. If you find it as useful as I do and also own an iPhone or Touch, consider getting the mobile version as well. The syncing is flawless.</p>
<p>Things is one of the most elegant and polished apps that I&rsquo;ve used. It promises to be a well-deserved hit.</p>

			 <p>This week, I decided to seek out alternatives to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NetNewsWire<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the popular feed reader from NewsGator.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My disenchantment with NetNewsWire began soon after NewsGator updated the app, switching from a private syncing service to Google Reader at the end of August. I didn&rsquo;t have any trouble migrating my feeds to Google Reader, as some users did.  I also didn&rsquo;t mind that the updated version of the NNW desktop client displayed unobtrusive ads. Hey, it&rsquo;s free (A paid version is in the works to get rid of the ad; a paid, ad-free version for iPhone is already available).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My problem with NetNewsWire is all about the iPhone app. Before NNW switched to Google Reader, my iPhone app was reliable, quick, and pleasant to use. After I upgraded to the newest version of the free NNW iPhone app, syncing began to take much longer and, more importantly, ceased to function reliably. Sometimes it would sync, sometimes it would not. It drove me crazy. Often, it would appear to sync correctly, but selecting a feed would result in a blank screen or (even more annoying) a blank screen with an embedded advertisement. I put up with this spotty performance for weeks (hoping it would get better, hoping it would be upgraded) before deciding to try something else.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m not saying that the NetNewsWire iPhone app is terrible. Based on user comments I&rsquo;ve read, many people seem to be happy with it. I will say that, in it&rsquo;s present version, I can&rsquo;t use it. A reliable feed reader on my iPhone is important to me. This frustration led me to consider other options. Since there are many, many front ends to Google Reader for the iPhone, why not shop around? It was an easy decision. And since I decided to try out something new for my iPhone, I also decided to try out other desktop clients. It was sort of a reverse halo effect.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After sifting through a plethora of reviews for iPhone RSS readers, I decided to go with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Byline<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (from Phantom Fish, current sale price: $3.99). I&rsquo;m pleased with my choice. The interface is clean and simple. There are many customization settings, the best of which is that I can choose to cache from 25 to 200 feeds for offline viewing (great for subway commuting). I can also set it to cache items only when I&rsquo;m using Wi-Fi, which is a handy option given I&rsquo;m on a slow Edge network.  Another nice touch is that I can choose to cache Web pages linked to feed posts. I can also read my feeds in landscape mode. It&rsquo;s worth a look. The one glaring item I&rsquo;m missing is the ability to mark a folder of feed items (or all items) as &lsquo;read.&rsquo; As far as I can tell, I can only mark individual feed items as &lsquo;read.&rsquo; A minor annoyance. According to the developer notes in the iTunes store, a new version is due out very shortly which promises to be a &lsquo;major update.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m looking forward to it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for a desktop replacement for NetNewsWire, the vote is still out. I&rsquo;m currently testing two options: Gruml and feedly.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gruml<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, currently in late stages of Beta, looks and operates much like NetNewsWire. The main difference is that Gruml offers more features. It allows me to send an article link from my feeds direct to a variety of social media sites. Or I can send an article direct to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MarsEdit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I find very handy (more blog tool integration is forthcoming). I can also post to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Instapaper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, my favorite iPhone &lsquo;read it later&rsquo; app. More, I can share items and add notes to articles (options currently unavailable with NetNewsWire). So far, I like it. It&rsquo;s easy on the eyes and is a quick, efficient way to get through a lot of feeds. It&rsquo;s much easier to look at than Google Reader.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feedly<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, on the other hand, is something completely different. It&rsquo;s a free browser-based aggregation service (available on the Mac for FireFox or Safari) that presents your articles in a pleasant, customizable magazine style. It offers strong social media integration and fancy algorithm-based filtering/recommendations that purportedly improve over time based on reading habits. It&rsquo;s also highly customizable. I&rsquo;ve tried these kind of news readers before and never really cared for them, but this one is pretty slick. I vastly prefer it to the iGoogle service. I&rsquo;m giving it a go. We&rsquo;ll see if I like it as much a month or so from now.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ve left NetNewsWire behind. I don&rsquo;t miss it. If you have a suggestion for a killer feed reader for the desktop or iPhone, I&rsquo;d love to hear about it.</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;re about to head North to my home state of Maine for a couple of weeks, a place I haven&rsquo;t lived for 20 years. Over the past two decades, I&rsquo;ve moved from Colorado, to Boston, to Guam, to Germany, back to Boston, to Germany again, to Hawaii, and (most recently) to Washington, DC. For work and pleasure, I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of traveling throughout Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and around the Pacific Rim. Yet I still consider myself to be from Maine. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I&rsquo;ve missed most about Maine over the years, aside from family, is the remoteness of the place. At points past Bangor, you can still get properly lost. There&rsquo;s the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, a natural water park over 90 miles long best seen by canoe. There&rsquo;s Baxter State Park, where you can hike to a distant pond, cast your fly rod all day, and not once hear or see another human. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And there&rsquo;s a vast section of unnamed townships between Bangor and Eastport riddled with lakes, covered by trees, and connected by logging roads. It&rsquo;s one of many places in Maine where moose and deer outnumber people. It&rsquo;s here that we&rsquo;ll be staying with my folks at their camp on the edge of a very large lake sparsely populated with a few camps, cabins, and campsites. It&rsquo;s a quiet place. It&rsquo;s far from other people, electricity, running water, or many of the other amenities we&rsquo;re accustomed to in our urban environment. And we can&rsquo;t wait to get there.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When I was a kid, I used to explore the world with the aid of a small shortwave radio and dream about leaving Maine. I would often spend hours at night, alone in my room, slowly churning through the channels. I could usually get Voice of America and the BBC. I would often pick up French language stations from Quebec. I once picked up an English language broadcast from Cuba. And, weather permitting, every so often I would pick up broadcasts in German, Chinese, or Russian. It was exhilarating. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->These days, I experience much of the world through the glare of LCD screens. At work, I spend the bulk of my days in front of dual monitors, shuffling between applications and responding to e-mails. At home, I often find myself sitting in front of another set of dual monitors, shuffling between a similar bunch of applications. And wherever I go, I carry my trusty iPhone. When I&rsquo;m not working on a project, I&rsquo;m likely managing multiple e-mail accounts, or floating between different social media sites, or surfing the Web, or doing something online.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->While I&rsquo;m a big fan of technology and gadgetry, the amazing ease and convenience many of us have grown to expect comes at a cost. Today, I can casually read news, hear radio stations, or watch broadcasts from all over the world. I can chat with friends in Europe as if they were next door. I&rsquo;m never disconnected from the Internet. Yet I rarely feel that sense of mystery and exploration that I experienced surfing for distant voices over the airwaves. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That&rsquo;s why I still like to listen to shortwave from time to time. It takes work. You need to find the right bands, you need to dial slowly, and you need to rely on chance because reception is tied to atmospheric conditions. Sometimes you find interesting broadcasts, sometimes you don&rsquo;t. Sometimes you only pick up the background radiation of the universe. In all cases, you can only listen. I like that.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m looking forward to visiting Maine. It&rsquo;ll be nice to get away from the city and unplug for a while. I&rsquo;ll also be taking a shortwave radio. For an hour or so during the trip, I plan to canoe out into the lake at dark, put on some headphones and see what I can tune in.</p>

			 <p>In my work life, one of my tasks is to produce an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->audio podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Soundtrack Pro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GarageBand<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to do the job. However, I recently tried out a few audio editing alternatives. I evaluated Adobe Soundbooth, Adobe Audition, and Audacity. I thought I&rsquo;d share my conclusions:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adobe Soundbooth CS4<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ($200). I found Soundbooth was a bit hard to use (read: non-intuitive) and had limited features. You can only split stereo tracks to mono by exporting them, which is silly. Even the free Audacity can split stereo tracks and convert to mono on the fly. You also can&rsquo;t divide clips (at least, I couldn&rsquo;t find how to do it after a reasonable period of time spent searching around). I was also unable to locate a scrubber, mixer, amplitude filter, and several other key features. They may be there somewhere, but I lost patience.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Audacity<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (free). I found this to be an excellent open-source, free editor. Available filter and effect extensions (add-ons) give this editor most of the features available in pro-level applications. For a simple audio project, this would be sufficient. However, I discovered several limitations which render the current iteration of the app ineffective for large, complex multitrack projects: (1) for me at least, the app starts to crash periodically when I have more than 15 or so tracks, (2) When you split a file, it creates a new track (instead of leaving it in the same track as Soundtrack Pro and Audition do). This is a problem when you are editing an hour-long recording and need to pull out only about 10 minutes of clips. You soon end up with tons of separate tracks and it&rsquo;s a pain to manage them; (3) You cannot drag and drop tracks around. You must manually select &lsquo;move up&rsquo; or &lsquo;move down&rsquo; from a drop-down list. This may not sound like a big deal, but it&rsquo;s a huge deal when you have many tracks and need to order them. (4) While you can mute select tracks (so you can edit one or two clips at a time) and shrink the size of each track to save screen real-estate (necessary when you have many tracks), these settings aren&rsquo;t saved. The next time you open up the app, all the tracks are &lsquo;unmuted&rsquo; and expanded to the full size. The good news about Audacity is that the development community is active, there&rsquo;s lots of online documentation and support, and the app continues to get better and better.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adobe Audition 3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ($350). Clearly, this is intended to be the main competitor for Soundtrack Pro. It does everything that Soundtrack Pro does, but several aspects of the design and layout of the application make it hard to use (at least from the perspective of someone very used to Soundtrack Pro). Overall, this is a very competent and powerful editor. However, I could do the same job in Soundtrack in about half the time. Again, I stress that this is coming from someone who knows Soundtrack Pro very well. I would recommend this to someone who has intensive audio editing needs, but does not wish to purchase or need the full Final Cut Studio.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My conclusion: I&rsquo;m ready to head back to Soundtrack Pro. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m most-familiar with it, but it&rsquo;s the easiest tool I&rsquo;ve found to put together podcasts. Another benefit of Soundtrack is that it seamlessly meshes with the other Final Cut tools for creating more complex multimedia and video projects (or for, say, pulling an audio track from a video interview to use in an audio podcast). <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s not my preferred tool for creating enhanced podcasts or exporting AAC/MP3 files, though. I use GarageBand for this. GarageBand exports MP3s and AACs faster than Soundtrack Pro and produces smaller files. This shouldn&rsquo;t be too surprising, considering it&rsquo;s tailored to podcasting. Soundtrack Pro does podcasting as well, but I&rsquo;ve found that the best way to use it is to export an uncompressed AIF file, and then work with that in GarageBand. It&rsquo;s also the easiest tool to use for creating enhanced podcasts (adding chapters, pictures, and links to the audio podcast). And, it&rsquo;s worth noting, it&rsquo;s the only tool to use other than Soundtrack Pro that I&rsquo;m aware of that allows one to create an enhanced file. GarageBand is, of course, also an all-in-one solution to create a podcast. You don&rsquo;t need Soundtrack Pro. What you get with Soundtrack Pro is much greater control in terms of editing, filtering, and mixing. For many people, though, GarageBand will do the job nicely. And it&rsquo;s cheap. Conversely, Soundtrack Pro only comes as part of the Final Cut Studio, which is quite expensive. I really wish Apple would offer the choice to by the apps in the Studio a la carte (an option they discontinued). If you&rsquo;re on a Mac and wish to try your hand at podcasting, definitely start with GarageBand. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Audacity is a good general-purpose editor that does the job for simple podcasts (no interviews, or simple Q/A interviews that do not require a lot of nonlinear editing, and those podcasts that are 10 or less tracks). It is a good &lsquo;starter&rsquo; solution for those who wish to try their hand at creating a podcast, and it runs on PC, Mac, or Linux. Audacity projects created on one platform open on any platform, which is nice. For more complex audio editing on a PC, Adobe Audition is a solid next step up. And if you want to go the Adobe route, you can always try out Audition and Soundbooth first with Adobe&rsquo;s free 30 day trial and see which works best for you.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In a few weeks, I&rsquo;ll have a completed screencast demonstrating how I put together a podcast, which I&rsquo;ll share in this space.</p>

			 <p>Just came across an interesting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->article on MacWorld<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Here&rsquo;s an excerpt:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Two well-known Mac hackers are updating a widely used hacking toolkit, making it easier to take control of a Macintosh computer&hellip;Although there are still many more exploits available for Windows software than for Macs, the new payload code means there is now “more or less the same functionality if you want to target a Mac box or a Windows box.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->No need to get too worried here, but it&rsquo;s a good reminder that we are not immune from the problems that plague Windows users. And, as this article suggests, it may be only a matter of time before we face similar problems. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There&rsquo;s a lot of brouhaha over the necessity of installing Mac antivirus software. I didn&rsquo;t run AV software on the Mac for a long, long time, but now I do. Why? It doesn&rsquo;t cost me anything. It only slows down system performance a tiny bit. And it makes me feel better. Here&rsquo;s a full rundown of the steps I take to ensure a basic level of security:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve used <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ClamXav<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (free) in the past and just started using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iAntiVirus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (free for noncommercial use) in the hopes that it&rsquo;s a bit speedier. It&rsquo;s not a bad idea to run an AV package, if only to prevent transmission of viruses to colleagues on Windows.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think a good password vault is essential. The excellent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1Password<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is my choice. It generates complex passwords, &lsquo;remembers&rsquo; them, and protects against phishing and keylogging.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LittleSnitch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to control and monitor outbound network traffic. I use this in the interest of privacy, but it will alert me if any unknown malware on my machine tries to phone home.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next, I&rsquo;ve set up my Linksys router with a kick-ass password and have set it to only accept connections from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->known MAC addresses<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that I&rsquo;ve manually added (household Macs, my iPhone, my wife&rsquo;s iPod Touch).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, I use Apple&rsquo;s built-in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firewall protection<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s a good idea to make sure it&rsquo;s turned on (go to System Preferences &gt; Security &gt; Firewall. Choose &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Set access for specific services and applications<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rsquo; Also, I have both boxes checked in the &lsquo;Advanced&hellip;&rsquo; preferences to enable logging and stealth mode). I also use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NoobProof<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Taken together, this establishes application and network firewall protection. See this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for more background on that.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If anyone has an alternative or better set-up, please share. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As an aside, if you use FinalCut Studio and keep getting an annoying prompt to allow incoming net traffic from &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->qmasterd<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; every time you boot (even though you&rsquo;ve already added it to the &lsquo;allowed&rsquo; list), try adding <!-- raw HTML omitted -->/Applications/Utilities/Batch Monitor.app/Contents/MacOS/Batch Monitor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to your list of applications that allow incoming connections. To do this, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->command+shift+g<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to paste in the file location.</p>

			 <p>I spent the past month on a ship out in the Gulf of Mexico serving as a data manager for a research expedition. I won&rsquo;t bore you with details about what I was doing, but I want to share some observations about my computing experience. I brought aboard a new 15&quot; Macbook Pro running Leopard with a virtual install (using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VMWare Fusion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) of Windows 7 Beta. Windows was essential, as the database in which I did my day-to-day work was not Mac compatible. Here are some highlights:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Data sharing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: While many of the people on the trip used Macs, several people used PCs. Among us, we probably had about 30 Terabytes or so of external disk storage. Problems arose when we needed to share data. The PC people&rsquo;s drives were generally formatted in NTFS. The Mac people typically used HFS+. The NTFS-formatted drives would mount on a Mac, but were read-only. The HFS+ drives would not mount on Windows PCs. No one used the FAT32 format, which is the only format that I&rsquo;m aware of that is read/write on both platforms. We ended up formatting a few drives in the FAT32 format so these drives could be moved around and shared. Since my disk was one of the external drives that had to be shared around more than others, my solution was to set it up with multiple partitions: an HFS+ partition to use for my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SuperDuper<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Clone backup, and a FAT32 partition for shared data. One interesting note: I formatted a 1TB drive with multiple partitions on a Mac in a matter of minutes. In comparison, it took about eight hours to format a 1TB drive with one FAT partition on a very robust and powerful PC laptop. Egads.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Data backup<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I was surprised that many people did not have a backup solution on the cruise. If their laptop tanked, they would not only potentially lose data, they would be out of commission for the duration of the expedition. I choose a cloned backup over Time Machine for this trip. The reason is simple: if something went terribly wrong with my laptop&rsquo;s OS, I could at least boot from the cloned external drive and keep working until a point in time when I could take a time out to restore from the clone back. With Time Machine, I would have had to stop working until I solved the problem or restored the backup to the laptop (which can be very time consuming).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Force-eject a CD<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: It&rsquo;s good to know how to do <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. At one point during my trip, I placed a corrupted DVD in my SuperDrive and couldn&rsquo;t get it to eject. Usually, I can get a stuck disc to pop out by evoking terminal and typing the command &lsquo;drutil tray eject.&rsquo; That didn&rsquo;t work. I tried disk utility. That didn&rsquo;t work.  The solution: I had to disconnect the drive from Windows, as it was in use by Windows via VMWare Fusion.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TextExpander<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Data entry often entails typing the same thing over and over again. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TextExpander<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is unbelievably useful for these sorts of repetitive tasks. In my case, I needed to paste the same blocks of text into my Windows database. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if TextExpander would work from Mac to PC, but it did. It wasn&rsquo;t as easy as it is on the Mac (i.e., I couldn&rsquo;t use TextExpander abbreviations in Windows), but it did the job. Once I had TextExpander populated with a slew of repetitive text snippets, all I had to do was select a snippet from the Mac drop-down menu, then click on it to paste it to the clipboard, then paste into the relevant field in my Windows database. It was a bit cumbersome, but much easier than typing the same thing over and over again.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Screenshots<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I was planning to use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Little Snapper<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to capture screen shots, but found this application to be too cumbersome and bloated for my tastes. I like the idea behind Little Snapper. It looks great. But it just didn&rsquo;t fit into my workflow. I found myself turning to Yellow Mug&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SnapnDrag<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s tiny, unobtrusive, and does the job well. It stays out of the way. I&rsquo;ve tried so many different screen shots apps, and I keep coming back to SnapnDrag. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: The only entertainment I brought on my trip was my iPhone. I brought music, books-on-tape, games, and some books to read via the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kindle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stanza<!-- raw HTML omitted --> book reading apps. Overall, the iPhone did the job. I was duly entertained. The one exception is this: the tiny screen didn&rsquo;t cut it for reading a book. It&rsquo;s a nice idea. It&rsquo;s not bad for quick reads like poetry or short stories. But it&rsquo;s just not a comfortable or enjoyable experience when it comes to reading an entire book in my opinion. Next time I&rsquo;ll bring a real book. Or perhaps I&rsquo;ll have one of those Mac tablet-touchscreen-Kindlesque-thingies rumored to be just around the corner. Final point: the iPhone also served me well for screenshots on the go. In case you didn&rsquo;t know this, if you press the two buttons on your iPhone or Touch at the same time, you device will take a snapshot of your screen and place the image in your Photo library. Very handy.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VMWare Fusion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I can&rsquo;t speak highly enough about this app. The ability to seamlessly run Windows alongside my Mac, to switch back and forth on the fly, to share folders, and to drag-and-drop between the two operating systems was priceless. Perhaps we take this for granted now, but just a few short years ago this would have been unthinkable.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>So, the site is back to normal. The question is how did this happen? My passwords consist of 12 randomly-generated digits/symbols, I&rsquo;m using the latest versions of WordPress and various plug ins. It could be that I was just one of the lucky first few to have their WP 2.7 installs compromised. It could also be that the attack came from a hole in one of my plugins.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It appears that only my wp-config.php and index.php files were overwritten. My MySQL database and theme files were unaffected. It wasn&rsquo;t that hard to recover from this, but it was a bit scary. The majority of my time was spent checking through all of my files to ensure I captured the extent of the damage. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Whatever vulnerability I had, this incident is a good opportunity to take stock of ways to minimize the chance of this happening. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.

I settled on the option to have Choosy present me with a choice of all browsers, regardless of whether or not the browsers are running (this option presents a nice floating menu similar to what you see with the familiar command-tab). It looks the developer has big plans for this little app: check out his development <!-- raw HTML omitted -->roadmap<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. He hasn&rsquo;t yet announced how much Choosy will cost when it ships.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Highbrow<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The second is called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Highbrow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Helium Foot Software. This tool offers many of the same features as Choosy, but there are substantial differences (the most noticeable of which is that it&rsquo;s not a preference pane). Once you place this app in your applications folder and run it, Highbrow appears in the menu bar (and automatically creates a login item without prompting&hellip;I personally prefer to be asked). Since it runs in the menu bar, Highbrow is faster than Choosy when you wish to change your default browser on the fly. The app offers three main options: you can select a default browser from a list of all of your preferred browsers; or you can choose to have your links open up in whatever browser you most recently used (something which Choosy doesn&rsquo;t offer); or you can have Highbrow ask you which browser you&rsquo;d like to use to open up a link (similar to Choosy, via a small floating window). Unlike Choosy, it does not offer you a choice among current open browsers. Highbrow will cost $14 (with a $12 introductory price. No details on how long this discounted price will be available once it&rsquo;s released).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Which one is best?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I tested both out and decided to go with Choosy for now. While both tools do the job, I prefer the way that Choosy works invisibly in the background. It also offers more customization options in an interface that is a bit more polished than Highbrow. If you are the type of person who likes menu bar apps (my menu bar is already quite full), or prefer to manually change your default browser per user session, try Highbrow. If you prefer to select from your currently-open browsers, or always want to choose from among a user-defined list of your favorite browsers, Choosy is a nice, unobtrusive option. The good news is that you can try both out for free to see which one works best for you.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why Bother?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why would you want to choose your browser when opening up a link? Web development is a primary reason: it&rsquo;s often useful to see how a page renders in different browsers. Beyond that, here are few other reasons I like to choose different browsers on different occasions:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firefox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> plugins<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Sometimes I receive a link in an email and I want to save it in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Delicious<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I want to send that link to Firefox in order to take advantage of my Firefox <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Delicious plugin<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. At other times, I choose FireFox to take advantage of plugins geared towards web development, such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->web developer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniWeb<!-- raw HTML omitted --> power<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I often like to use OmniWeb to take advantage of some of this browsers powerful features. For example, this browser allows me to set per-page site preferences, save multiple pages into groups for easy retrieval later on, and set up search shortcuts so I can quickly search a particular website right from the search bar. I also prefer the tabbed thumbnail views of all my open pages.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Safari<!-- raw HTML omitted --> speed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Sometimes I choose Safari when I&rsquo;m casually browsing because it&rsquo;s quite fast.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fluid<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. When I&rsquo;m using Fluid (which I use for my work web-based email so it appears as a stand-alone browser application), I usually prefer to open up links received in my inbox with other browsers instead of in another Fluid window. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A few other apps<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here are a few other (semi) related apps worth a look: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bookit<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This is a handy advanced bookmarking application that allows you to keep all your bookmarks synchronized across all of your browsers (and across multiple computers using .Mac). It costs $12. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->IC-switch<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This free application sits in your menu bar and allows you to change your default browser, emailer, FTP client, and RSS reader on the fly in one location.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RCDefaultApp<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This is a free preference pane that allows you to set the default applications that open for URLs, file types and extensions, and a whole lot more. It&rsquo;s a must-have little management app.</p>

			 <p>Shortly before I moved from Hawaii to Maryland, a friend of mine graciously gave me his 16 GB iPhone (Edge) after he bought a new 3G model.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It had a cracked screen, but I didn&rsquo;t mind. The shattered glass was mostly confined to one corner, so it wasn&rsquo;t too distracting. He didn&rsquo;t ask for any direct payment, only requesting that I send him a new Mac game around Christmas time when he&rsquo;s deployed to Iraq (he&rsquo;s a combat cameraman in the Navy).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This iPhone was unbelievably handy during our move, and I was and continue to be grateful for it (and since I didn&rsquo;t buy it from Apple or AT&amp;T, I don&rsquo;t have a two-year contract, which is nice. I&rsquo;m squeamish about locked-in contracts).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A couple of weeks ago, however, this iPhone started acting up. The dock connector would only work with Apple&rsquo;s supplied USB cable. It would not work with third party cables, chargers, or music docking stations.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just to see what would happen, I took it to my new local Apple store at Montgomery Mall in Maryland. I explained the problem, and the Apple Genius carefully tested it out. I was expecting to get a quote for a repair cost. I was shocked when the Apple Genius offered me a new 16GB Edge iPhone on the spot. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After he confirmed the defect, he informed me that a cracked screen is cause to void the warranty, so I really should protect it with a case (which I certainly do).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, I now have a new (refurbished) iPhone, and I am a very happy customer. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The moral of the story: if you have an iPhone with a cracked screen that has a legitimate defect that may not be tied to dropping it, it&rsquo;s worth a try to schedule an appointment with a Genius to see what happens.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My strategy was honesty, politeness, and preparedness. As I&rsquo;ve read online from other iPhone users, sometimes you get lucky. Make sure you back it up before you go, as the store rep will likely want to restore the software to see if it solves the issue.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For my friend who gave me his original iPhone, thank you. I admit that I feel a bit guilty. How about two Mac games for Christmas? Stay safe.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m on the road this week in Washington, DC. Away from my desktop Mac, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about data synchronization and the cost we should expect to pay for it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems that everyone is coming out with syncing solutions, and most of these solutions include web-based access to data. And soon, we can expect a flood of iPhone/Touch applications — many of which will be modified versions of traditional desktop Mac apps. We’re on the verge of a significant evolution in data synching and universal data presence. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On that note, I want to point out that NetNewsWire, the popular RSS reader, now offers online syncing. This update came out last month, but this is the first opportunity I&rsquo;ve had to test it out on the road. It works well. It allows me to easily access my RSS feeds, whether on my iPod Touch or on the PC laptop I’m using (under protest) for work. While there are many RSS solutions out there, the free NetNewsWire is one of the best. The addition of syncing means that I can manage and maintain my RSS feeds from any location.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s no stretch of imagination to see that seamless synced data is the future, and that this future is coming fast. What I&rsquo;m talking about is ubiquitous information — the ability to access all of one&rsquo;s important data anywhere, anytime, from any platform. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->While many services are heading in this direction, few yet do it with real style. NetNewsWire offers a good start. It will be better when there the NNW developers come up with  a customized iPhone/Touch app in addition to a web-based solution.  I’m confident it’s coming. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My suspicion is that we&rsquo;ll soon look back at this period in personal computing within a couple of years and smile at what we used to put up with: the now-defunct .Mac, Google apps, and the plethora of other syncing services we now enjoy will soon seem quite primitive.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Evernote is a good example of where we&rsquo;re heading. It&rsquo;s a great app and offers very good cross-platform access to your data, but a year from now I venture that the only thing that will make Evernote stand out from the crowd will be stellar Optical Character Recognition (Evernote&rsquo;s OCR is quite remarkable. Take a snapshot of some text, and it is quickly transformed into fully-searchable text). However, Evernote&rsquo;s ability to sync data in the &lsquo;cloud&rsquo; and serve it up on the web or on multiple installations of the app across platforms will be old hat.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Soon we&rsquo;ll enjoy the ability to access our data everywhere, anywhere, on any platform, whether on or offline — that&rsquo;s the promise, and it&rsquo;s coming very soon. A year from now, we will demand it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But what exactly should we expect? Web-based access is nice, but dedicated sister apps for our iPhone/Touch is even better. This is surely in our future, but at what cost?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve been closely following the development of Cultured Code&rsquo;s Things, an excellent task manager coming soon for the Mac. Concurrently with the creation of this app, the creators of Things are developing an iPhone/iPod Touch application dubbed ‘Things touch.’ It&rsquo;s going to be good. Things for the Mac is due out in the Summer; Things touch for the iPhone/Touch will hopefully come out at the same time.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But what I&rsquo;m wondering is this: will we be charged for different versions of the same application? In other words, if I buy Things 1.0 for the Mac, will I also have to buy Things for the iPhone/Touch for $9.99 (which seems to be a magic price point at this time). I’m guessing we will, and I say we shouldn’t complain too much. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Developing for the iPhone/Touch isn’t a matter of a simple port of a Mac app, or it shouldn’t be. It is about developing a unique user interface customized to this extraordinary mobile platform. It’s about minimalism. It’s about elegance. These considerations entail many design decisions and a lot of extra coding. Cultured Code’s blog for Things development is an excellent place to view a behind-the-scenes view of how difficult this can be for a well-thought out app. Check it out.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I initially thought that I would prefer to pay one price for an application, and that price would include a license for the mobile version of the app for the web and for the iPhone/Touch. However, I now see that this really wouldn’t work. If you don’t have a Touch or an iPhone, you clearly wouldn’t want to pay  a higher cost for a version of the app you don’t intend to use. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But what about web-based access to your data in a given app? Should that be a free addition or an additional cost? NetNewsWire offers their reader and web-based access/syncing for free. Yojimbo, on the other hand, offers no web-based access. You need to buy Yojimbo for $39. You can get web-based access to your data only if you buy Webjimbo for an additional $30 (an application which is made by a different company). Should I pay a lump sum of $70 for a desktop app with web access for a product like Yojimbo? I don’t think many will choose this option. I will not. In the case of Yojimbo, I’d like to see them either buy out Webjimbo and roll out their own solution. I’d also like to see them make their own iPhone/Touch app to access Yojimbo data on-the-go. I hope this is in the works.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This example hints at what I&rsquo;d like to see. In short, my preferred future looks like this: Desktop data-centric apps (e.g., Personal Info Managers , Task Managers) offer desktop and web-access version of their apps for one price. I think we should start to expect web-based access for many of the applications we buy and use on the Mac as part of a standard license fee. For the custom app designed for the iPhone/Touch, $9.99 is a good price point that I’d be willing to pay. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What’s clear is that ubiquitous data access is on the way. Pricing schemes for multi-point, ‘anywhere access’ apps continue to develop and mature. It will be interesting to see what model works best. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We&rsquo;ll soon see. My hope is that the iPhone (and perhaps the newly-launched MobileMe — the .Mac replacement) will drive a new revolution towards elegant data ubiquity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Post Script: I’m posting these comments in a hotel room using Wordpress’ web access on a PC laptop. As I’m pressed for time, I’m not adding links. I don’t have the time. It’s a testament to MarsEdit, TextMate and TextExpander — three  stellar Mac applications — that I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->would<!-- raw HTML omitted --> add links if I had a Mac laptop on-hand. On my PC, it would be too painful and time-intensive. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->P.P.S. Look for the next installment in the long-delayed PIM review sometime next week once I get back to Hawaii. I’ll next look at DevonThink Personal. I’ll also be commenting on the minor controversies surrounding my inclusion of VooDooPad in my review series.  The sneak-peek: I’m keeping VooDooPad, but I’m adding an extra Personal Information Manager to the series. I’ll explain my decision soon, as well.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I just spent an hour playing with Microsoft&rsquo;s just-released <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->WorldWide Telescope<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. At first glance, you may dismiss this is as just another space simulator like <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Starry Night<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stellarium<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Celestia<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Google Earth<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. However, I think it will stand on its own as a unique and extraordinary offering. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>WWT allows you to surf around the galaxy, seamlessly viewing stitched images from our civilization&rsquo;s best telescopes. Panning and zooming around the galaxy is exceptionally fluid — faster and more immersive than other offerings I&rsquo;ve seen. The technology behind this is Microsoft&rsquo;s new high-performance &ldquo;Visual Experience Engine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As one not ordinarily impressed by Microsoft products, I have to say that I really like WWT. The navigation controls are easy to use. The imagery is incredible. As you&rsquo;re sailing along, the thumbnails along the bottom of the screen instantly update to show you what&rsquo;s in the neighborhood. You can change views on the fly to look at galaxies, constellations, and other formations at different wavelengths. Overall, you get a sense of where you are in the universe better than other tools I&rsquo;ve used. One other feature that stands out: slick multimedia guided tours from experts and enthusiasts — and you can create your own tour, too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always happy to see a new, free astronomy tool for the public. This is certainly a great addition. The only bad news is that it&rsquo;s Windows-only.</p>
<p>I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t get the chance to test this package out given the minimum system requirements to run WWT on your Mac:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I would run BootCamp, but the version of Windows I own (Home Edition) is not compatible&hellip;and I don&rsquo;t want to buy a newer version of Windows. If you&rsquo;re in this camp (and your Mac is as good or better than mine), this is a working alternative if you want to try out WWT. It&rsquo;s worth a look. If you run Windows on BootCamp, definitely give it a try.</p>

			 <p>This is part two of a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->seven part series<!-- raw HTML omitted --> comparing Mac Personal Information Managers. Today, I&rsquo;m going to look at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yojimbo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> version 1.5.1.</p>
<p>As I sat down to begin this review, I pondered discussing the Yojimbo/samurai metaphor, when it struck me that the name of the company is perhaps more relevant. I had never considered why this company is called &lsquo;Bare Bones Software,&rsquo; but maybe it has something to do with a focus on creating applications that hone in on the bare essentials. It&rsquo;s just a theory, but Yojimbo certainly qualifies as bare boned: it&rsquo;s a lightweight, simple and elegant information manager.</p>
<p>But designing a simple and elegant application is a tricky business. You need to strike a delicate balance between functionality and user configuration options. You need to seek out and destroy bells and whistles. Unnecessary bloat and clutter must be avoided at all cost. If an application gets it right, it &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->flows like water<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; (to borrow a Taoist metaphor). It feels good to use. Of course, it also works very well. Few applications meet this high standard.</p>
<p>I think Yojimbo is on the right path, but it&rsquo;s not quite there yet.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Looking at it from the viewpoint of the user interface, Yojimbo stands out from the competition. A person who knows nothing about this app can, as advertised, jump right in and start collecting data. The user controls are standardized Apple fare, so you know what to expect. In fact, there&rsquo;s not much to say about the user interface because there&rsquo;s not much to it. It has a distinct minimalist feel to it. You have a left-hand column for organization (à la iTunes); you have a main window that displays your library; and you have a sliding split pane in the main pane to preview a selected item in your library (just like in Apple Mail). Aside from this, there is a standard popup inspector window that may be toggled off or on to display relevant info about a particular folder or library item. You may also customize the Yojimbo toolbar by adding/deleting your favorite items.</p>
<p>If there is any criticism to levy against the interface, it&rsquo;s that some users may pine for a few alternative layout options. Personally, I like the interface. It&rsquo;s one of the things that drew me to the program.</p>
<p>However, the samurai metaphor doesn&rsquo;t hold up as well for me when it comes to organization, filtering and searching. It&rsquo;s quite good, but it&rsquo;s not great. I&rsquo;ll get to this in more depth soon, but first let&rsquo;s look at getting data in and out of the program.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I should add that you can also add emails, but they are only imported as bookmarks — if you drag and drop them into the app you create a link back to the originating app (i.e. Mail). To get the actual email message text into Yojimbo, you can use this free <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AppleScript<!-- raw HTML omitted --> created by a Yojimbo developer (I use it in concert with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MailActOn<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>AppleScript support is a strong feature of Yojimbo, by the way. A quick web search turns up many user-generated scripts free for you to try. The only problem here is that they are a bit hard to find. I wish that Bare Bones would compile user-created scripts on their site.
In addition to dragging and dropping files into the app, you can directly type in new notes in rich or plain text. Unique among the PIM crowd, Yojimbo also provides two built-in templates to handle password and serial number data as well, which is a nice touch. One welcome addition would be a user-defined open template (or user-created templates). For example, I would like to create a car maintenance record template with field names that I define.</p>
<p>There are several other ways to add data besides direct input and the &lsquo;drag and drop.&rsquo; Yojimbo also offers a &lsquo;drop dock&rsquo; that integrates into any corner of your Mac screen. I put mine in the lower left-hand side of my screen and made it as transparent as possible so it doesn&rsquo;t stick out. The drop dock allows you to directly drag and drop to the main library or directly to a specific folder. I prefer this type of &lsquo;drop box&rsquo; to those that in other apps that sit directly on the desktop because I can get at it without leaving the program I&rsquo;m working in.</p>
<p>The only minor complaint I have about the drop dock is that you have to click <!-- raw HTML omitted -->precisely<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the word &lsquo;Yojimbo&rsquo; to minimize it. If you miss the target, it stays extended. If you are an Apple Dock user, you can also drag items to the Yojimbo dock icon. This will import the item to your library, but will not allow you to add an item to a specific folder.</p>
<p>Another way to add data is via a hotkey (F8 by default). This is my favorite feature. With Yojimbo running in the background, F8 will bring forth a quick-entry menu to import your clipboard. While this is handy, you need to know that it only handles text (a note, bookmark, password, serial number, or web archive). If you copy a file (a RTF, Doc, image file or PDF, for example), you can&rsquo;t import it with this function. If you try, what you&rsquo;ll get is an unlinked icon file representing the file type for the document. That&rsquo;s annoying. It is nice that you can directly convert a copied URL from your browser to create a web archive, though. According to the developer, Yojimbo will &lsquo;examine the clipboard, and guess what kind of item you wish to create, and will default to that editing panel.&rsquo; If Yojimbo guesses incorrectly, you can select a different item type by using keyboard shortcuts. This feature works well for me. One thing I don&rsquo;t get, though, is why the drop-down menu includes &lsquo;image&rsquo; as an item choice since this quick-entry method doesn&rsquo;t properly import images copied to the clipboard.</p>
<p>You can also enter data into Yojimbo with AppleScripts (like the previously-mentioned Mail script). And there are user-created scripts out there that let you add special bookmarks to your web browser for one-click bookmarking or web archiving to Yojimbo. Finally, you can use the Apple Services menu to import copied text or URL direct to Yojimbo. This is handy if Yojimbo is not currently running and you want to quickly add an item or link from a given open application.</p>
<p>With so many different options to get info into your database, Yojimbo truly makes data entry an effortless process.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The app includes ten options for &lsquo;smart&rsquo; collections (you&rsquo;ll probably be familiar with this concept from the Finder or iTunes). Smart folders are basically saved searches. With Yojimbo, you can view flagged items, recent, unsorted, untagged, archives, bookmarks, images, notes, passwords, and serial numbers. The frustrating part is that these smart folders cannot be modified in any way, nor can you create your own smart folders based on criteria of your choosing. Why not?</p>
<p>In addition to the &lsquo;dumb&rsquo; and smart collections, Yojimbo also serves up &lsquo;Tag Collections.&rsquo; This is a smart folder that collects items based on tags you&rsquo;ve assigned to items in your library. While it&rsquo;s nice that you can choose to collect more than one tag into a tag collection (for example, you can gather all of your items tagged &lsquo;food&rsquo; and &lsquo;recipe&rsquo;), there are several major shortcomings. First, you can only create a collection based on tags. You can&rsquo;t create a more complex collection (say, all items with &lsquo;food&rsquo; tags AND all flagged AND all recent items). Next, you can only collect tags that meet ALL conditions. There is no option to choose &lsquo;ANY&rsquo; as a selection condition. This means that I can collect all items tagged &lsquo;food&rsquo; and &lsquo;recipes,&rsquo; but I can&rsquo;t collect together items that have the single tags of &lsquo;food&rsquo; or &lsquo;recipes.&rsquo; What I would like to have is robust smart folder support, similar to what I get in the Finder or in iTunes. Yojimbo is really tying our hands by not giving us more control. The last problem is that the tag collection folders you create provide no clues about what tags are being collected. The only way to tell is to open up the tag collection for editing, or to choose an item in the collection and taking a look at the tags.</p>
<p>One final note: you can&rsquo;t drag and drop into a Smart or Tag Collection. This makes sense in that these &lsquo;folders&rsquo; really aren&rsquo;t folders at all, but are collections of items that meet certain search parameters. But wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if you could drag an item into a Tag Collection, with Yojimbo automatically appending the tag or tags for that collection to that item?
Yojimbo also offers two other ways to organize data: flagging and labeling. Flagging is a way to keep track of hot items that require follow-up, although you could assign any meaning to a flagged item. A flag can either be on or off. Chances are, you&rsquo;re already familiar with the flag from other Mac apps. Me? I don&rsquo;t use them very often. Color labeling is a common type of organizational method as well (most notably in Finder). Unlike Yojimbo&rsquo;s built-in Smart Collections, you get full control over labels. You may change the name of a label and you may choose the colors of your labels. While you can select multiple items and label them in batch, you cannot create a rule to label items based on tags. You also cannot add a color label to a folder. You can, however, search for items based on label names, which is nice (I can search for all &lsquo;work&rsquo; labels, for instance). I&rsquo;m not a big label fan (in Yojimbo or any other app), but I might use this feature more if I had the ability to create more complex custom Smart Collections (a very handy app called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hazel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a great example of how useful this can be — and it&rsquo;s using built-in Mac OS features!).</p>
<p>Now back to tagging. Yojimbo emphasizes tagging as a primary organization method. Indeed, tagged collections can be handy. But it&rsquo;s not good enough. And here is my biggest problem with Yojimbo: I need better tag management options. What I would like to see added is an on-the-fly tag filtering similar to what I&rsquo;ve seen in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniFocus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If Bare Bones won&rsquo;t give users the nested folder, then they might consider providing a more interactive method to filter through tags.</p>
<p>And speaking of tags, an inspector just for tags would be handy: a place to view them, batch change them, delete them. It would also be nice if Yojimbo would label orphaned tags in this list that are no longer being used. Note that it&rsquo;s currently not possible to change or delete a tag.
The ultimate test of how well your data is organized is put to the test when you try and find something. One easy way to do this is use Yojimbo&rsquo;s very speedy search engine. I have no complaints in this department. You can search by any word in an item, by tag and by label. Since Yojimbo is Spotlight-enabled, you can also search straight from Spotlight even when Yojimbo&rsquo;s not opened. I love having the ability to search for certain tagged items from my Yojimbo database using Spotlight. Very handy.</p>
<p>As for the search function <!-- raw HTML omitted -->within<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Yojimbo, it could be made better if we had that inspector pane with a list of all of our tags (what if I can&rsquo;t remember the tags I assigned?). The other way to find what you&rsquo;re looking for, of course, is via your Collections. I&rsquo;ve already talked about why this doesn&rsquo;t meet my needs. If I had full control over my smart collections, Yojimbo would be a much better tool for organizing and finding things. I would personally also like the added ability to nest folders. I know, I know&hellip;hierarchical folders are so 20th century&hellip;but many people like to manage their data this way. Yojimbo went half-way by providing folders, so why are they against providing a nested folder option for those who want it? I don&rsquo;t get it. If the idea is that you shouldn&rsquo;t really need hierarchical folders, then the developers should get rid of them entirely. I&rsquo;m all for that — provided I get much better tagging, filtering and smart folder creat
ion capabilities.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I also need to comment briefly on how Yojimbo data is physically stored. While some PIMs store your stuff in what&rsquo;s called a flat file structure (in other words, directly in the Finder), Yojimbo stores everything in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SQLite<!-- raw HTML omitted --> database tucked away in your user library. While I&rsquo;ve never had any trouble with the database, I came across many comments on the web from people worried about corruption. If the database gets corrupted, all of your data is potentially hosed. That&rsquo;s a bit worrisome.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s nothing much to worry about if you regularly back up your system. You can back up your Yojimbo database with Time Machine, in case your wondering. I came across some posts on the web suggesting it doesn&rsquo;t work, but it did for me. I tested this by deleting my entire database from my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->user&gt;Library&gt;Application Support&gt;Yojimbo folder<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, then I replaced these files with a backed-up copy from Time Machine. It restored just fine.</p>
<p>One more thing to consider with Yojimbo is that it duplicates a file upon import. So if I drag a PDF into the application from my Documents folder, it will still be in my Documents folder. I&rsquo;ll just have an extra copy of it now stored in the Yojimbo database. I&rsquo;m not crazy about this. I could delete the origninal files, but then I&rsquo;m relying on one database to store all of my precious files. I could keep two copies (one in my Document folder, one in my Yojimbo database) but things would get confusing if you later changed something in one of those versions; they wouldn&rsquo;t be in sync. My solution: I choose to not import most of my documents into Yojimbo. I primarily use it as a digital junk drawer.</p>
<p>Finally, I would be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention that Yojimbo supports encryption for individual items. It works great, but I wonder why Yojimbo doesn&rsquo;t have a built-in Smart Collection to view all encrypted items. A work around for this is to create a tag called &lsquo;encrypt&rsquo; for all your encrypted items, then create Tag Collection or search on that tag.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think Yojimbo excels at grabbing data of all varieties, but I&rsquo;m less enthusiastic when it comes to finding what I&rsquo;m looking for and filtering through my data collection. As my database grows, I find it increasingly hard to keep it organized and find what I want.</p>
<p>Still, there are many things that I really like. What I appreciate most about Yojimbo is how easy and quick it is to add new data. I&rsquo;m also quite fond of the minimalist user interface.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. Could I figure out how to use the application with minimal fuss (without documentation)?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The developer states that there is &lsquo;no learning curve.&rsquo; I found this to be largely true, but there are a few features you may not discover if you don&rsquo;t read the instructions. When you first launch Yojimbo, by the way, Bare Bones includes a helpful note that summarizes all the big ideas about how to use the app.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Yes, but I&rsquo;m growing less enthusiastic as my database grows larger. I&rsquo;m particularly frustrated that I can&rsquo;t create more complex smart folders. I also would like to see more robust tagging support.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Very well. In addition to the variety of data entry methods I detailed in this review, Yojimbo supports .Mac syncing for other Yojimbo installations on your network (and you can use your one license to install Yojimbo on multiple Macs in your household!). Yojimbo data is also spotlight indexed. This means you can search from spotlight on a tag name, and all of your Yojimbo items that match that tag will pop up (Yojimbo does not need to be running to use this). Super. By the way, if you want to access your Yojimbo database remotely (from a web browser or on your iPhone), a company called Flying Mac sells a slick Web 2.0 app called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Webjimbo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to meet this need. The downside? It will cost you an additional $30.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. How did the program &lsquo;feel?&rsquo; How &lsquo;Mac-like&rsquo; is it?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
This application has a great feel to it. The controls are intuitive. It&rsquo;s sleek. And if you want to know how Mac-like it is, consider this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple article<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Yojimbo is not perfect, but it&rsquo;s a reliable, speedy and handy tool in my toolbox. I think Bare Bones have hit on a solution with broad appeal, but there are a few areas that need refinement before I will say Yojimbo &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->flows like water.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for the Yojimbo review. Next up on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac PIM review series<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is an examination of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DevonThink Personal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Stay tuned.</p>

			 <p>I just read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MacWorld&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recent comparison<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of iWork Pages and Microsoft Office 2008 Word in the latest issue of their magazine. At the end of the article, author <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jeffery Battersby<!-- raw HTML omitted --> offers up some alternatives to these two dominant word processors.</p>
<p>He suggests BareBone Software&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TextWrangler<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Peter Borg&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Smultron<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as alternatives to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TextEdit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for basic editing. For full-fledged word processing alternatives, he suggests Hog Bay&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WriteRoom<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Mariner Software&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mariner Write<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or Nisus&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nisus Writer Pro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. These are all excellent programs.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d like to point out two other alternative entries that didn&rsquo;t make the list which deserve recognition: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bean<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for light text work and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mellel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for complex and robust text editing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>By the way, if you want to set Bean to auto-open your text docs (.txt, .doc, .rtf, etc.), you can set this preference using the &lsquo;Get Info&rsquo; dialogue box (right click on a file, choose &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Get Info<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,&rsquo; select Bean from the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open With<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; drop down menu, then choose &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Change All<!-- raw HTML omitted -->'). Alternatively, you can install Rubicode&rsquo;s free <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RCDefaultApp<!-- raw HTML omitted --> preference pane and select the document formats to open with Bean from this panel. This is a bit of a side note, but RCDefaultApp is an excellent tool for assigning and managing document types (extensions) with programs on your Mac.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ll say this: it&rsquo;s not for everyone. Some people don&rsquo;t like the look and feel of this program — you can&rsquo;t customize the app&rsquo;s toolbar, the steely monochrome finish may put you off, and almost all of the functional choices for the app are arranged into a densely compressed floating palette on the side of the screen. Me? I&rsquo;ve grown fonder and fonder of the design over time. It has a certain minimalist, Zen appeal. At any rate, you&rsquo;ll very quickly decide if you love it or can&rsquo;t stand it. Mellel costs $49 (which includes two years of free updates).</p>
<p>Now back to work on my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yojimbo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> review&hellip;</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is the first post in a seven-part series comparing Mac personal information managers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now you have a new problem: choice. The good news is that there are a hefty number of productivity and organization applications for the Mac to help reduce your clutter. The better news is that they all offer ample free trial periods. The bad news is that they all claim to be the perfect solution for organizing your mess of information, and you just don&rsquo;t have the time to test them all out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to try to sort through all of the Mac-based PIMs in this series. Instead, I&rsquo;ve chosen five applications to review. While this is a bit more than I intended to tackle at first, I think five is the magic number. I settled on these five because they represent the best of the best of what&rsquo;s available for the Mac. All of these applications share a similar feature-set: the ability to store, organize, and retrieve personal information from text notes, to images, to PDFs, to web pages all from one place. The difference, of course, is in the details.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a summary of each application (listed in reviewing order):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Initial release: Jan. 2006 | Current price: $39</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->DEVONthink Pro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: You get everything in DT Personal, plus the following: a three-pane view option; no upper limit to images/PDF items; full CSV/TSV file support; import ability from Address Book and iData 2; export to OmniOutliner ($79.95)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->DEVONthink Pro Office<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: You get everything in DT Pro, plus the following: email archive support, scanner support, OCR capability, and web access/sharing for your databases ($149.95)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->VoodooPad Pro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: You get everything in VDP standard, plus the following: a built-in web server, meta values for pages, event triggers, and the ability to encrypt whole documents ($49.95)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Importantly, this exercise also forced me to do a lot of searching and a lot of reading: I didn&rsquo;t just count download and users, I read all the comments on each of the three sites (iusethis, versiontracker, macupdate). I now have a much better platform from which to dive into my reviews. I also spent several hours reading through reviews from other blogs, as well as reading through material on developer&rsquo;s sites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth pointing out, though, that I did this retrospectively. In other words, I chose these five programs for personal reasons: I currently use Yojimbo for short notes, snippets and serial numbers. I use DEVONthink to store all of my writing clips and ideas (fiction, primarily). And I like to use VoodooPad as a learning/flash card tool (right now, I&rsquo;m using it to store notes as I learn javascript). What initially led me to these three applications is what is often called &lsquo;buzz.&rsquo; As someone who follows Mac software rather closely, I heard (and read) repeated positive comments, so I gave them a try. Simple as that. Am I happy with them? Not entirely, but they&rsquo;re pretty good. How&rsquo;s that for an answer? I promise to offer a bit more detail for the reviews!</p>
<p>For the other two apps — Together and EagleFiler — I&rsquo;ve not yet used them. However, they were recommended by readers who know a heck of a lot about Mac software (and organization), so I added them to the list. From what I&rsquo;ve read so far, they appear to be rising rapidly in popularity among people I consider power users. I will use review these two programs last to take advantage of the full evaluation period (Together offers a 15 day trial; EagleFiler offers 30 days).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going into this series with an open mind. I&rsquo;m perfectly willing to abandon my current multi-app workflow if I find another app (or apps) that better serve my needs. This last statement &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->serves my needs better<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; is an important distinction to make: my needs are not your needs, so I&rsquo;m not going to claim that my conclusions will apply to all users. What I think will come out of this is a fairly good synopsis of each app which I hope will serve as a launching point for readers who are trying to figure out where to begin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be evaluating these applications with an emphasis on the same set of questions I&rsquo;ve used for other reviews on this site:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. Could I figure out how to use the application with minimal fuss (without documentation)?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. How did the program &lsquo;feel?&rsquo; How &lsquo;Mac-like&rsquo; is it?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;ll also be looking at questions specific to info managers: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how well could I organize all of my stuff? How easy is it to get data in/out? How is the information stored? What organization tools are available? How scalable is it? How easy is it to find what I&rsquo;m looking for?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I hope to get these reviews out in fairly rapid succession, but I have to warn you that it&rsquo;ll take some time. I&rsquo;m going to evaluate the applications I&rsquo;m most familiar with first.</p>
<p>Stayed tuned for a review of Yojimbo.</p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But first, I want to say how happy I am that my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->offline experiment<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is over. The TV part was easy, since I don&rsquo;t really watch TV. The Mac part was quite hard. I&rsquo;m happily back online now, with no great lessons learned (other than I prefer to be connected; no great surprise there).</p>
<p>Now, about my impending series on Mac organizers: I agree with those of you who suggest I tackle <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Together<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (formerly known as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->KIT<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) rather than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Evernote<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Together is clearly in the same class as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DevonThink<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->EagleFiler<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yojimbo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Evernote is clearly not. Together is also quite popular, so it&rsquo;s a good target for this series. Thank you to those who commented for steering me straight.</p>
<p>Of these apps, I have substantial experience using DevonThink and Yojimbo. This will give me a good baseline. However, I have no experience using EagleFiler and Together, so I&rsquo;ve downloaded the trials to test them out. I want to use them each intensely for at least a week to give them a fair shake. I also have decided I will add <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VooDooPad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to the mix because I use it, I really like it and it&rsquo;s substantially different from the others. It deserves to be in the lineup.</p>
<p>Now that I have identified the five apps I wish to review, I must say that I&rsquo;m still pondering how to tackle this series. I just read through some existing review series <!-- raw HTML omitted -->suggested<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by reader brab. These reviews are excellent and I highly recommend you give them a read. In fact, these posts were so informative and thoughtful that I have to take a few days to rethink how I want to approach this. I want to write something that is value-added. I don&rsquo;t want to rehash what&rsquo;s already out there. I want to try to take a fresh look. More to come.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2008 Mac a&rsquo;hiki Tech Fest<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (sponsored by the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hawaii Macintosh and Apple Users' Society<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>The highlight of this gathering was a keynote speech by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matt Mullenweg<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fame. Most of his talk focused on the capabilities of WordPress, which I&rsquo;m already familiar with as a WP user. I did, however learn a few interesting things:</p>
<p>First, WordPress is about to launch an interesting new theme called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Monotone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that&rsquo;s geared towards displaying photos in a blog. It is interesting because it&rsquo;s dynamic: the theme samples your top photo in your most recent post and automatically generates complementary colors for the layout of your page. Each time you post a new photo, your base theme colors change to match that photo. It&rsquo;s a nice idea, and I expect variations on this dynamic sampling to generate more interesting themes in the future. I look forward to taking a peek at the code behind this.</p>
<p>Next, I learned about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gravatar.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. While I was aware of the Gravatar concept, I was unaware that WordPress hosted the Gravatar service. Apparently <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Automattic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Mullenweg&rsquo;s WP.com company, acquired Gravatar last October. If you sign up for a Gravatar, your unique little photo will follow you around the web when you&rsquo;re posting comments on any site that supports the Gravatar feature. Yet another example of how the web is turning into a more cohesive entity for the individual.</p>
<p>Following that, I learned of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bbPress<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BuddyPress<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — two WordPress.com offshoots. The first service is a free package for simple forum hosting. It purportedly makes setting up a forum as easy as setting up a WordPress.com site. I&rsquo;m curious about how well it will integrate into a current WP installation. The second is a set of WordPress plugins (for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress MultiUser<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) which offers a very simple and easy way to transform any blog into a social network platform à la MySpace. The difference is that you don&rsquo;t have to sign up for a social service with this — you create your own social center.</p>
<p>BuddyPress is still under construction, and Mullenweg doesn&rsquo;t recommend you launch into it yet. But he said a stable package will soon be available. I like the idea of segmented user-level social networks. While it&rsquo;s not a new idea, Mullenweg argued that this package will make it simple enough for anyone to create and maintain — which would be something new.</p>
<p>What this all added up for me was a clearer vision of how WordPress is positioning itself to lead the market with free, simple and easy to use blogging and social forum platforms in a variety of flavors. When I add up the myriad of options presented by WordPress.org, WordPress.com, WordPressMU, bbPress, and BuddyPress (all free services, by the way), I get the sense that this is developing into something very special.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also struck by the aggressive development-and-release schedule of the WordPress team. That I can expect a major upgrade with significant improvements every few months is a tangible benefit that has so far kept me from leaping to another platform. I especially like that I have full access to this platform for free. Since I use the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; version of WP, I can do whatever I like with it. I can even try to make a better commercial platform to compete with WordPress. I like the WP business model. As Mullenweg put it, anyone can use and exploit the open source WP package. It&rsquo;s up to the WP.com team to make their commercial implementation of this package a top consumer choice (they make money, by the way, by offering premium upgrades).</p>
<p>Finally, Mullenweg showcased a site produced by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ford<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (yes, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Ford) on WordPress. Wow. I took one look at this site and was inspired to see if I could push my WordPress installation a bit further. I&rsquo;m amazed that this site is based on WordPress. I&rsquo;ve toyed with moving to a new platform (recently I tried porting this site over to Drupal — you can see the test result <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), but I&rsquo;m more inclined now than ever to stick with WP. Especially when I consider how much time and energy I&rsquo;ve put into understanding how this package works (and how little time I have to delve into another package!).</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in seeing Mullenweg&rsquo;s talk, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HMAUS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is planning to post a videocast of the talk soon. As a side note, I put down five bucks on a raffle at the HMAUS event, hoping to win one of two iPod Shuffles or the Belkin USB hub. I walked away with an extra-extra large University of Hawaii football jersey and a can of Chef Boyardee <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac and Cheese<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Hmm.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m pulling the plug on my computer and TV this week. I&rsquo;ve been challenged by my wife to join her in National <!-- raw HTML omitted -->“Turn Off Week”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — an annual event tied to Earth Day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to make a point about society&rsquo;s dependency on all things electronic. Actually, I&rsquo;m quite fond of electronic gadgetry.

<p>I&rsquo;ll return on Apr. 28 with the first post in a new in-depth series comparing Mac information organizers. I&rsquo;d like to keep the comparison to a manageable level, so I plan to review a maximum of four apps.

However, I&rsquo;m still open to suggestions if you&rsquo;d like to see a particular application included in the comparison showdown.</p>
<p>For the first post in this series, I&rsquo;ll present a broad overview of what is offered on the Mac in this category, along with a bit of commentary. I&rsquo;ll also finalize the selection of four apps.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for this week. Time to power down.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve convinced many people to buy a Mac over the years, but there&rsquo;s one person I cannot convert. My mother refuses to go Mac. To put this in proper context, you should know that she is not a computer novice. She has no problem fixing driver problems or troubleshooting a PC. She runs several web sites. You should also know that she is not hostile to the idea of using a Mac.</p>
<p>So, she&rsquo;s computer-saavy and open minded about trying the Mac OS. So why doesn&rsquo;t she buy one?</p>
<p>I have to admit that I was disappointed when she recently purchased an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HP Pavilion DV740US<!-- raw HTML omitted --> laptop for $1149. This model came with a 1.67GHz Centrino Core Duo processor, 3GB DDR2 RAM, Windows Vista Premium, a DVD±RW/CD-RW drive with Blu-Ray read support, a 5-in-1 digital media reader, a 320GB hard drive, a TV tuner and a 17-inch screen. It has a built-in camera and wireless capability. In short, it&rsquo;s designed to be an full-featured entertainment center. It weights in at 7.7 pounds.</p>
<p>She did take a look at the Mac options, but only considered the MacBook Pro — the 17-inch screen was a minimum requirement. But at a starting price of $1,999, the MacBook Pro was just too expensive. It also didn&rsquo;t have as many features. For her, the HP model was the obvious choice. The primary user of this machine, my father, is happy with it. What&rsquo;s he doing with it? Primarily surfing the web and checking emails. While he might not use a lot of the power and features of the HP, he gets a zippy machine with a big keyboard and large screen. And when he&rsquo;s not using it, my mother has access to a powerful second computer in the house (her primary is a Gateway desktop).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to convince her to buy a Mac for years. My main points on why I feel the Mac is the best choice will be familiar to most readers of this site:</p>
<p>You may pay more upfront for a Mac but it&rsquo;ll generally last longer. I think that most low-cost PCs are designed to be disposable, and they are generally made with cheap components. My second generation iBook G3, though, is seven years old and still going strong. Macs are generally well-crafted machines. Also note that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Windows may be much more expensive than the Mac OS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the long run.</p>
<p>I also believe that the Mac user experience is superior thanks to the OS and the aesthetics of the hardware design (and apparently just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->thinking about Apple<!-- raw HTML omitted --> makes one more creative, which is kind of scary).</p>
<p>Next, I say that the extra bells and whistles of entertainment machines like the HP DV740US don&rsquo;t add up to much. I think the Mac excels at honing in on the essentials that people need while steadfastly avoiding feature bloat. This is just my personal choice, but I&rsquo;m wary of everything-and-the-kitchen sink PCs. In my experience, the base capabilities may appear to be great, but in reality they just don&rsquo;t work that well. And they generally don&rsquo;t work well together. We Mac users like to say that our machines &lsquo;just work.&rsquo; Well, that&rsquo;s because Macs just work.</p>
<p>Security is generally considered to be much stronger on the Mac. The main counter-argument I hear on this point is &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sure, but just wait until the Mac gets more popular<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rsquo; Actually, I think that&rsquo;s a<!-- raw HTML omitted --> valid point<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. We shouldn&rsquo;t take our relative security for granted. The Mac OS is fairly secure, but it&rsquo;s far from perfect. It is, however, vastly more secure than a machine on Windows. I don&rsquo;t see this changing anytime soon.</p>
<p>I also think that Mac software (both Apple and third-party software) is vastly superior in terms of quality, user experience, and OS integration to what you can get on a PC. This is subjective, I know. But it&rsquo;s true!</p>
<p>Finally, the Mac is the only platform today that can (legally) run the Mac OS along with Windows and most other operating systems. And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Macs Run Windows Vista Better Than PCs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> according to just-released Popular Mechanics test.</p>
<p>In the end, my arguments lost out. Here were the main points behind her HP decision:</p>
<ol>
<li>She would love to try out the Mac OS, but she is quite content with Vista</li>
<li>The 17-inch screen is a must — and the Mac only offers costly options in this category</li>
<li>The HP offers many more features for much less money</li>
</ol>
<p>I have to say that I understand the decision to go with HP, but I think the cost benefit of the cheaper HP will decline over time. I think you get what you pay for. However, I have nothing but anecdotal evidence to back this up. Perhaps the HP will stand the test of time just as well as a Mac, or perhaps it doesn&rsquo;t matter because it&rsquo;s cheap enough to be replaced without much concern in two or three years.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that I still haven&rsquo;t persuaded her to switch, she remains very interested in the Mac OS. She noted that she would like the option to install the Mac OS on a Windows machine so she could test it out. She&rsquo;s not the only one. This happens to be a current hot topic in the Mac community. For more on this, see the April 17 Macworld article, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Frankenmac! What&rsquo;s in a Mac clone?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Personally, I would love to have the option to legally install Mac OS X on a PC. In fact, I would be tempted to build my own PC tower if I could run Mac OS X on it. Will Apple ever license the Mac OS to run on non-Apple computers? I doubt it, but then again I never thought I&rsquo;d see Apple switch to Intel. While I&rsquo;m interested in installing Mac OS X on non-Apple machines, I fear what this might do to the the OS over time. Apple&rsquo;s decision to lock the Mac OS to Apple computers no doubt helps to maintain control, security and compatibility.</p>
<p>Of course, Apple could also add more products to their line to compete with low and mid-range PC desktops and laptops. While this would surely increase market share, would this be the beginning of the end of Apple&rsquo;s distinctive quality? I think it might: these cheaper machines would logically need to integrate cheaper components to get the price down, right?</p>
<p>At any rate, Macs today cost a bit more. And they are not as fully-loaded as many PC offerings out on the market. For your money, you get higher-quality, well-integrated components. You get the only machine that (legally) runs the Mac OS. You get more security. You get better software. And, most importantly, you get the Mac user experience — it&rsquo;s hard to explain this to PC users, but it&rsquo;s an experience that is worth the price of admission.</p>

To put this in proper context, you should know that she is not a computer novice. She has no problem fixing driver problems or troubleshooting a PC. She runs several web sites. You should also know that she is not hostile to the idea of using a Mac. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, she&rsquo;s computer-saavy and open minded about trying the Mac OS. So why doesn&rsquo;t she buy one?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have to admit that I was disappointed when she recently purchased an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HP Pavilion DV740US<!-- raw HTML omitted --> laptop for $1149. This model came with a 1.67GHz Centrino Core Duo processor, 3GB DDR2 RAM, Windows Vista Premium, a DVD±RW/CD-RW drive with Blu-Ray read support, a 5-in-1 digital media reader, a 320GB hard drive, a TV tuner and a 17-inch screen. It has a built-in camera and wireless capability. In short, it&rsquo;s designed to be an full-featured entertainment center. It weights in at 7.7 pounds. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->She did take a look at the Mac options, but only considered the MacBook Pro — the 17-inch screen was a minimum requirement. But at a starting price of $1,999, the MacBook Pro was just too expensive. It also didn&rsquo;t have as many features. For her, the HP model was the obvious choice. The primary user of this machine, my father, is happy with it. What&rsquo;s he doing with it? Primarily surfing the web and checking emails. While he might not use a lot of the power and features of the HP, he gets a zippy machine with a big keyboard and large screen. And when he&rsquo;s not using it, my mother has access to a powerful second computer in the house (her primary is a Gateway desktop). <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve tried to convince her to buy a Mac for years. My main points on why I feel the Mac is the best choice will be familiar to most readers of this site:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You may pay more upfront for a Mac but it&rsquo;ll generally last longer. I think that most low-cost PCs are designed to be disposable, and they are generally made with cheap components. My second generation iBook G3, though, is seven years old and still going strong. Macs are generally well-crafted machines. Also note that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Windows may be much more expensive than the Mac OS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the long run.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also believe that the Mac user experience is superior thanks to the OS and the aesthetics of the hardware design (and apparently just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->thinking about Apple<!-- raw HTML omitted --> makes one more creative, which is kind of scary). <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next, I say that the extra bells and whistles of entertainment machines like the HP DV740US don&rsquo;t add up to much. I think the Mac excels at honing in on the essentials that people need while steadfastly avoiding feature bloat. This is just my personal choice, but I&rsquo;m wary of everything-and-the-kitchen sink PCs. In my experience, the base capabilities may appear to be great, but in reality they just don&rsquo;t work that well. And they generally don&rsquo;t work well together. We Mac users like to say that our machines &lsquo;just work.&rsquo; Well, that&rsquo;s because Macs just work.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Security is generally considered to be much stronger on the Mac. The main counter-argument I hear on this point is &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sure, but just wait until the Mac gets more popular<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rsquo; Actually, I think that&rsquo;s a<!-- raw HTML omitted --> valid point<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. We shouldn&rsquo;t take our relative security for granted. The Mac OS is fairly secure, but it&rsquo;s far from perfect. It is, however, vastly more secure than a machine on Windows. I don&rsquo;t see this changing anytime soon.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also think that Mac software (both Apple and third-party software) is vastly superior in terms of quality, user experience, and OS integration to what you can get on a PC. This is subjective, I know. But it&rsquo;s true! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, the Mac is the only platform today that can (legally) run the Mac OS along with Windows and most other operating systems. And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Macs Run Windows Vista Better Than PCs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> according to just-released Popular Mechanics test. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the end, my arguments lost out. Here were the main points behind her HP decision:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. She would love to try out the Mac OS, but she is quite content with Vista<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. The 17-inch screen is a must — and the Mac only offers costly options in this category<!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. The HP offers many more features for much less money<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have to say that I understand the decision to go with HP, but I think the cost benefit of the cheaper HP will decline over time. I think you get what you pay for. However, I have nothing but anecdotal evidence to back this up. Perhaps the HP will stand the test of time just as well as a Mac, or perhaps it doesn&rsquo;t matter because it&rsquo;s cheap enough to be replaced without much concern in two or three years.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Despite the fact that I still haven&rsquo;t persuaded her to switch, she remains very interested in the Mac OS. She noted that she would like the option to install the Mac OS on a Windows machine so she could test it out. She&rsquo;s not the only one. This happens to be a current hot topic in the Mac community. For more on this, see the April 17 Macworld article, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Frankenmac! What&rsquo;s in a Mac clone?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Personally, I would love to have the option to legally install Mac OS X on a PC. In fact, I would be tempted to build my own PC tower if I could run Mac OS X on it. Will Apple ever license the Mac OS to run on non-Apple computers? I doubt it, but then again I never thought I&rsquo;d see Apple switch to Intel. While I&rsquo;m interested in installing Mac OS X on non-Apple machines, I fear what this might do to the the OS over time. Apple&rsquo;s decision to lock the Mac OS to Apple computers no doubt helps to maintain control, security and compatibility. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course, Apple could also add more products to their line to compete with low and mid-range PC desktops and laptops. While this would surely increase market share, would this be the beginning of the end of Apple&rsquo;s distinctive quality? I think it might: these cheaper machines would logically need to integrate cheaper components to get the price down, right?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At any rate, Macs today cost a bit more. And they are not as fully-loaded as many PC offerings out on the market. For your money, you get higher-quality, well-integrated components. You get the only machine that (legally) runs the Mac OS. You get more security. You get better software. And, most importantly, you get the Mac user experience — it&rsquo;s hard to explain this to PC users, but it&rsquo;s an experience that is worth the price of admission.</p>

<p>To be honest, I spent the better part of the day evaluating industrial gear cases, and I just don’t think you’d find it that interesting. Unless of course, you’re willing to spend $600 on a camera case&hellip; No? Ok, then. In the interest of keeping fresh material coming in, I thought I&rsquo;d talk a little about one of the trends in professional gear that is making good progress on it’s way down from the halls of NAB to the consumer market: tapeless acquisition.</p>
<p>Tapeless acquisition is a technology that is just now really beginning to realize its potential. A few years ago it was only available in high-end professional cameras. We’re talking cameras that cost more than the gross national products of many small South American countries. More recently, though, the technology has found it’s way into lower-end field cameras such as Panasonic&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->P2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Sony&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XDCAM<!-- raw HTML omitted --> lines. These are the cameras that serve as the primary tools of documentary crews, independent video journalists and anyone else who needs to move fast and shoot broadcast-quality footage. Essentially, they are BMWs compared to the higher-end &lsquo;Ferraris&rsquo; of the camera world. The good news this year is that we&rsquo;re beginning to see pro technology (such as quality tapeless acquisition) filter down to the consumer level at a Chevrolet price point!</p>
<p>So what does this mean for you? No more spending $5 for a single 60-minute DV cassette. Great! But wait, there’s always a catch isn’t there? Let’s take the JVC <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Everio<!-- raw HTML omitted --> line as an example. These cameras can store up to 37.5 hours of standard definition footage onto their 30GB hard drives, so the issue is not how much drive space you will need.</p>
<p>The first major issue is the compression used to obtain that very tempting specification. A great number of internet reviews of the Everio line indicate that the video produced is soft and exhibits obvious artifacts. This is not exactly what I would like to see in my preserved-for-posterity memories. The other issue is compatibility for playback and editing on your computer. Unless you intend to use the bundled proprietary software to chop your precious memories into bite-sized YouTube morsels, you’ll need to carefully check the compatibility of the camera with your editing software before purchasing.</p>
<p>For the readers of this site, you should know that the JVC cameras don’t bundle any Mac love. While the JVC website states that “third-party software is available for Macintosh,” I spent nearly 15 minutes (all my ADD would allow) searching for exactly what “third-party software” was available. Guess what&hellip;I need to keep looking. Now, in fairness to the little Everios, every report I&rsquo;ve read indicates that the &lsquo;direct from camera to DVD burner&rsquo; feature worked simply and flawlessly — but that really takes the fun out of the whole process.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve picked on JVC cameras here, these are issues that should be considered and researched when considering offerings from any of the major manufacturers.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s get back to the main benefit of tapeless acquisition. No capturing tapes! It’s really that simple. Not only do you no longer need to buy the expensive little things, you don’t have to spend all that time capturing them into the computer in order to work on your upcoming Academy Award-nominated cinematography. Assuming you do your research and get yourself a great little camera that works perfectly with your Mac, transferring video from you camera will be as simple as copying files from a thumb drive. If your camera is really cool, it will even utilize super-secret CIA scene detection technology to break your happy little trip to the zoo into distinct clips of monkeys, panda bears and tourists falling into the polar bear pit. You may not realize now how great of a time saver this is, but it is. Put it this way: the pros utilize modern indentured servitude (interns) so they don’t have to do it themselves. Most of us have to do it ourselves.</p>
<p>In summary: do your homework. Look for documented compatibility with your Mac and software. Pay attention to the little stickers that tell you what size CCD the camera has; more megapixels + bigger CCD = higher quality video. HD is cheap — and all HD cameras should give you the option to shoot standard definition as well, so look for HDV or AVCHD format cameras. Finally, be sure to buy a case to protect your investment&hellip;and remember: with video gear you really do get what you pay for.&quot;</p>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s one more audio-related post. I suppose it&rsquo;s now officially &lsquo;audio week&rsquo; on this site (this wasn&rsquo;t planned, but I&rsquo;m on a roll).</p>
<p>I just listened to the latest episode of a my favorite radio show. The topic: an exploration of the relationship between biology and human engineering. Sound boring? Not interested in science? Listen to this show before you make up your mind. This just might be the best radio program in America. It&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Radiolab<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WNYC<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in New York.</p>
<p>Of the many things that make this show special, the most apparent to me is the production quality. It&rsquo;s not over-produced. It&rsquo;s more about how cohesive and engaging the stories are in each episode. You know when you see a really great documentary or movie that just grabs you? The kind of show that draws you in? When you lose track of time? Radiolab is like that — for your ears.</p>
<p>What makes the show stand out? It&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint. It has an experimental edge to it. They do things that I&rsquo;ve never heard before on other &lsquo;educational&rsquo; shows. They interview people (just like any other radio show), but the way they integrate the interview can be quite jarring and unexpected. Example: they often let the interviewee introduce him or herself — interviewers for radio/video usually ask the subject to &lsquo;state your name and title.&rsquo; This typically never airs. It&rsquo;s a method to ensure that the hosts get the name and title correct. On Radiolab, they often use this pre-interview audio to introduce the subject expert. This wouldn&rsquo;t work if they did it every time, but my point is that they are willing to present a story in very untraditional ways.</p>
<p>Moreover, the storyline is sometimes nonlinear, which is relatively rare in audio stories. Interview sound clips can show up again later for effect (for humor, for emphasis). They also create and embed really interesting sound effects to illustrate visual elements. Some work, some don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s always entertaining and usually pretty funny, though. They also frequently use ambient sound to create tension, suspense and mood better than any show I&rsquo;ve heard. In short, few shows know how to use sound as well as Radiolab. Few shows are as willing to push traditional boundaries to tell a story.</p>
<p>This experimental edge combines with the best part of the show: top-notch story telling. I don&rsquo;t have much to say about this other than this: they spin a good tale. They take a potentially dry &lsquo;science&rsquo; topic and bring it to life. They do this by finding amazingly interesting story segments.</p>
<p>I also think a part of what makes it work is that the co-hosts seem to genuinely like each other. They sound like they&rsquo;re having a chat. It comes across so naturally, you might be fooled into thinking the show is effortless and spontaneous. That&rsquo;s the kind of flow I&rsquo;m talking about here — the kind you might expect in great video, but rarely find in an audio production.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big radio fan (the geeky &lsquo;public radio&rsquo; sort of fan) and I&rsquo;ve been listening to radio stories for a few decades now. I think what I&rsquo;m trying to say is this: Radiolab is breaking new ground and raising the bar. It&rsquo;s tossing aside traditional rules of documentary audio and opening up the medium. It&rsquo;s 21st century radio. While <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This American Life<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (another amazing show) perhaps led the wave of alternative story telling and has done wonders to push the radio documentary envelope, Radiolab builds upon this. It takes it to a new creative level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth going back in the archives to hear past shows. If you don&rsquo;t, you won&rsquo;t hear about fighter pilots with out of body experiences, the sound of a sleeping cat brain, the man who takes two hours to wipe his nose and thinks it only took him a moment, the guy who has had the same sound stuck in his head for over a decade, the woman who is really two women in one. In short, there are some great (and fascinating) stories to be found here.</p>
<p>Also check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Ring and I: The Passion, The Myth, The Mania<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — it&rsquo;s not a Radiolab program, but it was produced and hosted by Jad Abumrad (Radiolab co-host, co-creator). Abumrad is an outstanding storyteller — and this is one of the best audio programs I&rsquo;ve ever heard. If nothing else, this show will surely answer all of those enduring questions I know you&rsquo;ve had about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wagner&rsquo;s Ring Cycle<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a Mac connection here: Radiolab is available as a free podcast on iTunes. And the show is produced on a Mac.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://forestriver.rocks/2008/04/09/mac-hearing-aids.html">Mac Hearing Aids</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://forestriver.rocks/2008/04/09/mac-hearing-aids.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2008-04-09 01:56:57 -0500">Apr 9, 2008</time></a>

			 <p>I decided to stick with the audio theme today because there&rsquo;s a new Mac sound enhancement app on the streets. It&rsquo;s called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hear<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, it&rsquo;s from a company called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->JoeSoft<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and it&rsquo;s now available for $49.95.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the hype about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hear<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->from the developer&rsquo;s site<!-- raw HTML omitted -->): &ldquo;Hear greatly improves audio quality in movies and music throughout all of your Mac OS X applications. With Hear, music is richer, movie sound and dialog is clearer and games will blow you out of your chair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to know: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hear<!-- raw HTML omitted --> appears to be a repackaged, more polished and (according to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->forum reports<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) less buggy version of a Mac app called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OSS 3D<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. OSS 3D is the creation of Dmitry Boldyrev, the developer of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MacAmp<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (now defunct) and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WinAmp<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (still a popular Windows media player, now a Time Warner AOL subsidiary). As I understand it, OSS 3D development has now ended with the release of Hear.</p>
<p>I tried the OSS 3D demo last Fall (which, incidentally, costs $20 less than Hear; you can still buy it, but there is not and never will be a Leopard version). I also downloaded the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hear<!-- raw HTML omitted --> demo today.</p>
<p>What do they have in common? A scary number of users options that may intimidate you. I tweaked some of the various and plentiful manual controls for a while — long enough to convince me I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing. Then I headed for the presets. I tested <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hear<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with a range of music and a video using built-in settings optimized for various types of musics, scenarios, 3D, etc. I listened to some sound with my built-in iMac speakers. I listened with my headphones. I listened with my plug-in JBL desktop speakers.</p>
<p>My preliminary conclusion is that this product has potential, but I&rsquo;m not convinced many people will dish out $50 for the potential of enhanced sound. I say &lsquo;potential&rsquo; because my results were mixed — I achieved some pleasant results, some painful results. I was surprised that some of the presets just didn&rsquo;t sound very good to me. I had some distortion issues. When I chose a &lsquo;rock&rsquo; genre song from my collection and then chose the &lsquo;rock&rsquo; preset in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hear<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip; I have to say it sounded better without it.</p>
<p>If you are a serious audiophile, an audio professional, and/or more knowledgeable about audio settings than me, you may love this. Reading through the OSS 3D forums, it appears that there are (were) many passionate OSS 3D users who swear by this digital enhancement package, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hear<!-- raw HTML omitted --> appears to be the new face of OSS 3D.</p>
<p>It would be unfair of me to say this isn&rsquo;t a good product after such a short trial. More likely, it&rsquo;s user ignorance. Still, what I look for in a good Mac app is usability right from the install. I didn&rsquo;t get that sense here. I also didn&rsquo;t get adequate user documentation. But I&rsquo;ll end on a positive note: it did sound good when I ran it straight through my iMac speakers. It produced a solid subwoofer sound and made my built-in speakers sound better (wider, deeper, more robust). It also produced some noticeable and nice 3D enhancement with the video I tested out.</p>
<p>If sound is important to you, why not give <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hear<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a try. They offer a 30-day trial. You may have a better experience than I.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll close by noting that I currently use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SRS iWow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ($19.99), a plug-in for iTunes. It improves the sound of iTunes music quite significantly — especially for laptop speakers. It also simulates 360 degree sound for headphones. I use it with my iMac and it makes a noticeable difference. I like it. Mostly because it&rsquo;s very easy to use and the results sound quite good to my ears (I immediately know when it&rsquo;s not turned on when listening to my music). The one thing it doesn&rsquo;t do, though, is work outside of iTunes. That&rsquo;s a big shortcoming. I&rsquo;d like to see this tool integrated into all of my Mac&rsquo;s audio output.</p>
<p>Until that day, it appears that Hear is the main game in town for system-wide audio enhancement. If anyone knows of any other similar app, please let me know.</p>

			 <p>I like the iTunes music store as much as the next person, but the selection is poor when it comes to the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->world music<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; category.</p>
<p>For music that is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->other-than-English-language-pop<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (also known as &lsquo;world,&rsquo; &lsquo;global, or &lsquo;international&rsquo; music — in other words, the vast majority of the music produced on this planet), you might want to try <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Calabashmusic.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The selection is outstanding, it&rsquo;s DRM-free, tunes are cheap and it&rsquo;s based on fair trade (50 percent of each sale goes back to the artist). For audiophiles, the sound quality is pretty good — downloads range from 160-192kbps. The files are in MP3 format so you can play them on any player. You can also return to Calabash at anytime and re-download your purchased music.</p>
<p>Did I mention the selection is outstanding? Calabash organizes their large music collection in two ways: browse by regions of the world or sift through scores of musical genres (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Portuguese Fado, anyone? How about Afro-Peruvian?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). Once you find something that interests you, try out a 60-second preview. They also offer 10 free downloads a week, which is a great way to start exploring new music.</p>
<p>I bring this up now because the folks over at Calabash are trying to launch a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->peer-to-peer microcredit program<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for international artists. Their goal is to raise $100,000 by May 31 so they can get it off the ground. You may have heard of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kiva.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This is the same idea, but for struggling artists around the globe. I think it&rsquo;s a great idea. Peer-to-peer microfinancing is one of the more interesting, innovative and positive things made possible by the social web.</p>
<p>If you love music from around the globe, also check out National Geographic&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->online music section<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The music content for this site is provided by Calabash, but it&rsquo;s packaged a bit differently here. They strive for a more contextual, cultural focus as you might expect. Some of the content also comes from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PRI<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (producer&rsquo;s of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The World<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a great news program that daily highlights the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->global music scene<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, often in a political context) and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Afropop Worldwide<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (the show that started me on my international music path back in the 1990s). One more: check out the BBC&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->world music offerings<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Footnote<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I love world music, but why do we have to call it &lsquo;world music?&rsquo; Isn&rsquo;t all music from this world? It makes no sense. David Byrne wrote a really good editorial way back in 1999 for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New York Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that gets to the root of the issue. It&rsquo;s called &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I Hate World Music.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;</p>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting online game: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Glass Bead Network<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. A short message about this new venture appeared at the end of an email message received from my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->web host<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this evening:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->object<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->: each online player (a max of four people for one game) is dealt a hand of &lsquo;beads.&rsquo; Each bead is a picture of a person, place, thing. The object is to place one of your beads on the board next to another bead to form a connection. It&rsquo;s up to you to decide how the beads are connected. Once you conjure up a connection, you present it for the other players to evaluate. The other players then either approve your connection or reject it. If your connection is challenged, you may refine it until all agree it&rsquo;s a valid &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->linkage<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.'<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The hard part is that you only have a finite amount of time to make a connection that all players agree is valid (the amount of time you have to form a link is determined in the game setup). If you can&rsquo;t come up with a good link, you pass to the next player. The first player to place all of his/her beads (or, if the board is filled up, the player with the least number of beads remaining in hand) wins.</p>
<p>I like the open-ended nature of the game. The most ingenious part of the play is that the players must form a sort of social contract to decide if a play is valid or not. This agreement-based gameplay reminds me of a philosophy book I read long ago called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Infinite and Finite Games<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by James P. Carse.</p>
<p>Sidenote: I didn&rsquo;t find a reference to this on the game site, but the name and inspiration for this game must come from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Glass Bead Game<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Hermann Hesse.</p>

		<a href="https://forestriver.rocks/2008/04/04/twitter-hmm.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2008-04-04 03:24:45 -0500">Apr 4, 2008</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Ok, I have a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter account<!-- raw HTML omitted --> now. Many people really enjoy this service, so I&rsquo;m ready to give it a shot. But I have a confession: I don&rsquo;t really get it.</p>
<p>Is this just a passing fad? Is it a revolutionary mode of communication? Or is just fun? Why should I invest the time?</p>
<p>An any rate, I&rsquo;ve posted my first short message to tell the world what I&rsquo;m up to. I have microblogged. By &lsquo;the world&rsquo; I mean that I am currently following/followed by only two people: a friend of mine in San Diego&hellip;and Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Actually, I just added Obama to my list because, well, why not. He&rsquo;s surely in friend-acceptance mode right now and I support his candidacy. Don&rsquo;t mind getting updates about what he&rsquo;s up to. And I&rsquo;m sure he will eagerly read my tweet. Right.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I have more questions:</p>
<p>Why is Twitter substantively different or better than instant messaging? Why not send an email? Is it about networking? Is it about popularity? Is it about exchange of information? And here&rsquo;s the real question on my mind: is there such a thing as being too connected?</p>
<p>I can see that what sets a microblog apart from email or chat is universal availability/viewability across time. In other words, it links &lsquo;friends&rsquo; together with added benefits: anyone can peek in to read the posts of others (which encourages networking among like-minded people, I assume) and it&rsquo;s a sort of time-logged journal. By this, I mean it&rsquo;s like a shared microjournal among peers that persists in a thread across time into web eternity (I guess that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called a microblog — no big revelations here). Is this a good thing? Maybe.</p>
<p>Whatever is behind this phenomenon, I&rsquo;m going to try to get into the social web thing a bit more. I&rsquo;m still pondering, though, the limits of sharing personal information.</p>
<p>Are you a Twitter user? What do you get out of it? Why do you do it?</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ImageWell<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a lightweight image editor for the Mac, is no longer offered as a free download. With today&rsquo;s launch of version 3.5, the developers now offer only one choice: a paid full-feature version for $19.95. Prior to 3.5, a limited version of the app was offered for free with an upgrade option to unlock more powerful features.</p>
<p>ImageWell excels at quick and simple processing (aimed primarily for images heading for the web). It specializes in watermarking, adding annotations, creating shaped borders, taking screenshots, and batch processing. It&rsquo;s not a bad option for a fast, easy to use, tiny little app if your image editing needs are light.</p>
<p>ImageWell offers a lot of what you will find with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Skitch<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In fact, you may find that the free Skitch beta serves up more choice, flexibility and options if your main interests are capturing screenshots, marking them up, and sharing them online. However, you&rsquo;ll get more image editing functionality with ImageWell. In this respect, it&rsquo;s most similar to Flying Meat&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Acorn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in that both emphasize lightness, low cost, and simplicity and strive to meet most of your basic image editing and image sharing needs.</p>
<p>Perhaps the developers of ImageWell are making a smart move by staking out the low end of the Mac image editing field. The feature set and the price are not bad. I think the developers are trying to head for that sweet spot between Skitch and Acorn: not as much power as Acorn, but more features than Skitch, for the relatively low price of $19.95. Sure, the user interface is not as elegant as Acorn&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s not free like Skitch (and who knows if Skitch will be free once it leaves Beta status) but it&rsquo;s cheap and it offers a lot of tools. Acorn offers more image editing possibilities and is easier to use. Of course, it costs $30 more than ImageWell, too — a pretty big price gap.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be curious to see how this change in strategy pans out for the ImageWell developers.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a cheap, simple editor (cheaper and simpler than, say, Photoshop) but think your image editing needs may grow over time, take a look at some of the other low cost desktop apps out there like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pixelmator<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ($60) and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GraphicConvertor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ($35) before you make a decision. Of course, you could also see if the various <!-- raw HTML omitted -->free online editors<!-- raw HTML omitted --> meet your needs. If all you want is a quick drag-and-drop tool to create nice thumbnail images for your blog or website, you may also want to try <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thumbscrew<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (free).</p>

			<h1><a href="https://forestriver.rocks/2008/03/30/wordpress-released.html">WordPress 2.5 released</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://forestriver.rocks/2008/03/30/wordpress-released.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2008-03-30 01:50:31 -0500">Mar 30, 2008</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Just a few short hours after I posted my WordPress review, version 2.5 was released. Of course this is a very major update, and of course my review is for version 2.3 (the prior version — there is no 2.4).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The new release offers, among other improvements: simpler plugin updating, easier gallery creation, a much better Dashboard (admin panel), enhanced security features, full-screen writing capability, a better WYSIWYG editor, and better searching capability (that now indexes static pages in addition to posts). Check out the full list of improvements <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I just completed the upgrade. It installed flawlessly. The changes to the admin panel are indeed very substantial. It&rsquo;ll take some time to get used to. The automatic plugin updating is quite nice, I have to say. Also, the Dashboard &lsquo;start&rsquo; page is much more useful than the previous version.</p>
<p>The only minor problem I&rsquo;ve noticed so far is that the WP <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Archive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> widget named has changed from &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Archives<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; to &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Archive<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rsquo; This is significant if you use image replacement for the widget title — you&rsquo;ll have to update your CSS to reflect the new name.</p>
<p>I also noticed that the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wp-config.php<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is different from previous versions, so be sure to use this updated file (this file hasn&rsquo;t changed in a long while, so I&rsquo;m guessing that many people are in the habit of keeping their existing config file during upgrades).</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to copy over your old MySQL settings (user name, password, database name) into the new file (which is called &lsquo;wp-config-sample.php&rsquo;), delete the old config file, then delete the word &lsquo;sample&rsquo; from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wp-config-sample.php<!-- raw HTML omitted --> file.</p>
<p>The difference in this file is the addition of a secure key field. Enter a long, complicated key in this field as indicated (no need to remember it). This is part of a new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->secure cookie encryption protocol<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll add my thoughts on this new version when I post the RapidWeaver Vs. WordPress final wrap-up.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This is the third in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->four part series<!-- raw HTML omitted --> comparing WordPress with RapidWeaver (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->and speaking of RapidWeaver, don&rsquo;t miss the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->comment<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from a lead RW developer on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that review<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a blog publishing system for Mac, PC, or Linux. I&rsquo;m assuming that most people who read this probably have heard of WordPress and have perhaps noted that many blogs use it. In terms of blogging platforms, WP ranks second in use only to Google&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blogger<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. That equates to millions of users. What accounts for this popularity? In short, it works. And it&rsquo;s free. Not only can you get a blog up and running quickly with WordPress, you can manage your blog with one of the best browser-based administration panels out there.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re considering WordPress, you need to understand the difference between <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress.org<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option is the WordPress answer to Blogger. It&rsquo;s a commercial web hosting venture which employs a version of WP that allows for multiple blogs within one installation. Once you sign up, you get hosting space, automatic installation, and a fixed number of themes, plugins, and widgets to customize your site. In general, you won&rsquo;t be able to modify much and you can&rsquo;t put ads on it. However, you will be able to modify <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than you would with Blogger. You&rsquo;ll be able to choose from a palette of widgets, move them around on your sidebar, choose a header photo (this option is only available with some themes), and activate some plugins, but you won&rsquo;t be able to style your page or modify the theme layout/design with the free package. Nor will you be able to choose from the wider universe of WP plugins and widgets available around the web.</p>
<p>The basic package is free, but there are paid upgrades if you want to customize the styles of your chosen theme, get more storage space, or change your domain name to something other than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->your_blog.wordpress.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Most users choose the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WP.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option because it&rsquo;s easier to use, it&rsquo;s just as free as the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.org<!-- raw HTML omitted --> version, it offers better technical support, and it includes site hosting.</p>
<p>Last point: since you will be using tried and tested themes, plugins and widgets with this option, you will be ensured of a standards-compliant site.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.org<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option offers an open source package of core files to run a WP blog. It is free to use and abuse however you&rsquo;d like within the terms of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->General Public License<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you choose this option, you will get a download of the files needed to make WordPress run, but you won&rsquo;t get a place to host it, you&rsquo;ll have to install it yourself and you won&rsquo;t get dedicated support. You will, however, have access to a veritable sea of plugins, widgets, and themes — and you&rsquo;ll be able to fully customize and tweak your site. In other words, you have a level of freedom unmatched by what you&rsquo;d get from a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WP.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hosted blog. If you want the full features of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.org<!-- raw HTML omitted --> version, but don&rsquo;t want to deal with the hassle of setting it up, there are many <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hosts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that offer automatic installation (or you can get a WP expert to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->install your blog for free<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if your web host meets the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->requirements<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>Last point: you may also choose the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->multi-user version of WP<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if you want the ability to have limitless blogs with unlimited authors with only one installation. It&rsquo;s freely available as well (and, in case you are wondering, it&rsquo;s the same platform used by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WP.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>This rest of this review will focus on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress.org<!-- raw HTML omitted --> package because the flexibility inherent in this version most closely approximates the full capabilities of RapidWeaver.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While RapidWeaver is a website creation tool that also supports blogging, WordPress is first and foremost a tool for the weblog. Sure, you can add static pages to a WP site, but it is primarily designed to handle dynamic content. And it&rsquo;s designed to support things that bloggers need most (moderating comments, managing posts, adding categories and tags etc.) right out of the box. While you can add photo pages, videos, and a variety of other content to your WordPress blog (either in posts or on stand-alone pages), it is generally not as easy of a task as it would be on RapidWeaver. And that&rsquo;s the main difference. If you don&rsquo;t want to pay any money up front, flexibility and customization options are important to you, and you have some (or great) knowledge of CSS and HTML, it&rsquo;s a superb choice. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to know a bit about PHP and MySQL, too. If you don&rsquo;t know anything about this stuff, you will still get a lot out of it because the basic administration tools are quite simple and robust. You just won&rsquo;t be able to customize your site design/layout as much as you might like without a bit of research and studying.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Just like RapidWeaver, WordPress is based on the template (WP calls them themes). As I&rsquo;ve noted before, templates are great because they are generally designed by people who know something about, well, design. Most of the hard work is done for you. However, if you roam far and wide for WP themes, you may find that some of them are not standards-compliant. Most are, though. However, they may no longer be compliant once you&rsquo;re done modifying them. Fortunately, your can test this out compliments of the free <!-- raw HTML omitted -->W3C validation tools<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>In addition to themes, WP offers plug-and-play extendability with plugins and widgets. Plugins are bits of code created by clever individuals that extend your site&rsquo;s functionality. There are a ton of them out there and they are generally extremely easy to deploy. Some of the most popular are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Askimet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (a very effective spam filtering plugin), the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->All in One SEO pack<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; (to easily optimize your site for search engines), <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Analytics<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (to get some site stats), <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress.com stats<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (more stats — you need to sign up for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WP.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to use them on your site but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you need a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WP.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-hosted site), and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lightbox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (responsible for the screenshot behavior of this site). But that&rsquo;s just the very tip of a large iceberg. The WordPress <!-- raw HTML omitted -->plugin page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a good place to start your search.</p>
<p>Widgets are a special type of plugin. They are basically chunks of code that you can mix and match with ease to customize you sidebar content. WordPress comes with a bunch of widgets out of the box (search tool, calendar, recent posts, etc.), but that&rsquo;s just the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->start<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In addition to the standard WP widgets, for instance, this site uses an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->enhanced blogroll<!-- raw HTML omitted --> widget (which rotates links every time the page is loaded), an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->enhanced recent comments<!-- raw HTML omitted --> widget (to display chunks of the most recent comments) and a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feedburner<!-- raw HTML omitted --> widget (to optimize this site&rsquo;s RSS feed).</p>
<p>Adding plugins, themes, and extra widgets to your site is easy. I&rsquo;ll touch on this in the next section.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p> </p>
<p>Inside there, you&rsquo;ll find a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->plugins<!-- raw HTML omitted --> folder, an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->uploads<!-- raw HTML omitted --> folder, and a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->themes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> folder. My assumption here is that you have some sort of FTP client with which to install and view these files. If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll need one. I use Panic&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Transmit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Installing new themes and plugins couldn&rsquo;t be easier (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->remember: extra widgets are also installed as plugins<!-- raw HTML omitted -->): you drop your new theme files in the themes folder; and (you guessed it) you place plugins in the plugins folder. The uploads folder is a good place to store images and other files that you want to place on pages or in posts. This organization scheme permits you to change themes on the fly while ensuring that your plugins and extra files remain properly in place. In other words, all of the images, files, and plugins are separate from your theme. That way, you can change your theme and your site maintains the same functionality and content, just with a new look.</p>
<p>All of your posts, comments, tags, etc. are also separate from your theme files — they are stored in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MySQL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> database. WordPress works its magic with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PHP<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an open source language that dynamically calls up and displays data and content from your database. It&rsquo;s a bit complicated if you&rsquo;ve never worked with it, but WordPress offers extensive <!-- raw HTML omitted -->documentation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to help you understand how a site is managed. In a nutshell, the theme files control the layout/design and styles of your site (and you can manually add static content in here, too). The theme also contains all the PHP functionality that makes your blog dynamic. If this all sounds complicated, it is. It takes some getting used to. Once you get it down, though, you&rsquo;ll find that WP is perhaps more robust and flexible than RapidWeaver, mainly because all of WP is accessible for modification and the pool of people who make plugins and themes for the WP platform is huge.</p>
<p>The hardest part to get used to with WP is how the PHP pages are split up into sections (into separate header, footer, index, etc). When you load up a WP blog page, all these disparate parts are called into play via the PHP code and then reassembled on the fly to spit out a dynamically-generated HTML page in your browser. When I first started to understand how all of these PHP files work together (and I confess I don&rsquo;t understand all of it) it struck me as quite ingenious. It reminds me of an analog watch: looked at from the front, it&rsquo;s a stylish, simple interface that tells the time. But open up the back, and you reveal a blur of cogs and springs and little gears somehow working together to create the time. Anyhow, to really get it, be prepared to spend some time with it. My suggestion? Try installing two copies of WP on your web host (one to use for your blog, one to hide and play with) or install <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MAMP<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on your Mac and install a copy of WP there. MAMP, by the way, is a great tool to set up a personal webserver.</p>
<p>While RapidWeaver content and user options are manipulated on a page-by-page basis and via inspector panes, WordPress is managed from a browser via a web-based Admin panel. The obvious benefit of this approach is that you are not tied to your desktop to manage your site. The Admin panel is the heart and soul of WP. It&rsquo;s designed to give you the tools you need to effectively manage a site, even if you&rsquo;ve never done anything like this before. For the most part, it succeeds. There are many aspects of the admin panel that I really appreciate. For instance, it&rsquo;s very easy to activate and deactivate plugins. It&rsquo;s as simple as turning them off and on. The discussion (comment) moderation is also excellent. You can choose to moderate every comment, just moderate comments from new users, or choose many options in between to get your settings just right. The built in commenting options blow RapidWeaver&rsquo;s external <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Haloscan.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> comment solution out of the water. In fact, many say it&rsquo;s the best of any platform.</p>
<p>In fact, the level of fidelity with which you can control almost every aspect of your blog is superior. Given this tool is specialized for blogging, perhaps that&rsquo;s not too surprising. You will also appreciate how easy it is to delete or edit a comment, monitor registered users, and move Widgets around (which is a pleasant drag-and-drop experience). You can also email posts in remotely with a few simple set-up steps. Like RapidWeaver, though, some of the admin windows are so chock full of options that it can be confusing to grasp.</p>
<p>For me, the weak link in the Admin panel is the tab for writing a new post. WP allows you to enter your post via a WYSIWYG or code-based window, but I find it to be clunky and limiting. At times, I&rsquo;ve made changes to my posts via this panel only to find that other parts of my code changed in unexpected ways. I shudder at the thought of typing up a lengthy post (like this one) through the Admin panel. Likewise, I don&rsquo;t care for uploading images or files for my posts via the Admin panel. I think it&rsquo;s tedious; and it&rsquo;s awkward to go back and move or change file names using the panel. My preference for editing and modifying posts? More on that in the next section.</p>
<p>To summarize the basics: you add themes and plugins by dropping them into folders on your web host using an FTP client; you manage all of your content, presentation options and plugins via the Admin panel; you change the design of your site by modifying the PHP and CSS files of your theme. Easy right? It&rsquo;s actually not as complicated as it may sound, and it&rsquo;s much easier if you use some good third party Mac apps.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Much more so than RapidWeaver, WordPress benefits greatly from the addition of third-party editing tools. For instance, I previously noted that I find writing posts on the web-based Admin panel a little annoying. It&rsquo;s not that the WP Admin panel is bad. It&rsquo;s actually quite good, especially compared to other CMS admin panels I&rsquo;ve used. Still, once I tried <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MarsEdit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I discovered how much better the experience could be. If there is one companion tool that is a must-have for writing, editing, tagging, and categorizing posts, this is it. Some people choose to set up MarsEdit to accurately preview what the post will look like. As I&rsquo;ve mentioned, I post to a local server on my Mac on a mirror copy of this website using MarsEdit. I polish it locally, then publish it once I&rsquo;m done. I find this to be an ideal set up.</p>
<p>Another third party tool you will need is a good FTP client. This will be useful when you need to update WP to a newer version (make sure you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->back it up<!-- raw HTML omitted --> first!), add new plugins or upload images.</p>
<p>If you are inclined to create/modify your theme, you will also benefit from an external editor such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TextMate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BBEdit/TextWrangler<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and a CSS editor like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CSSEdit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I don&rsquo;t want to go to deeply into this topic, but I want to point out that WP really rocks when you get a good workflow going with some extra tools. Of course, this comes at a cost. If I add together all of the third party tools I use to manage the site, WP actually cost me about as much as RapidWeaver! I have to ask myself how much of the pleasure of working with WordPress is due to these additional Mac apps. Tools like CSSEdit, TextMate, MarsEdit, and Transmit truly make it a pleasant workflow. In fact, one of the main reasons I stuck with WP for this site is because I really like to use these tools. Sounds kind of silly, perhaps, but I&rsquo;ll stick by it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one final tip: you can set up your WordPress admin panel to appear as a desktop application (and put it in your Dock) using a little app called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fluid<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s still in Beta, but I&rsquo;ve found it works great. With Fluid, in fact, you can set up any web-based app to function as a stand-alone application. Very handy.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing about WordPress: it&rsquo;s a question of how far you want to take it. Pretty much anything you want to do is possible, but the need to understand a bit of what&rsquo;s going on with the code behind the scenes increases exponentially the more you deviate from the standard WP model. In this sense, WordPress is an excellent training tool to learn about PHP, MySQL, CSS, and XHMTL. As I&rsquo;ve said, I strongly recommend installing a version locally on your Mac using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MAMP<!-- raw HTML omitted --> just for this purpose. Over time, you&rsquo;ll start to gain the ability to bend your site to your will with greater skill. Until that time, however, you&rsquo;ll be surprised how far you can get with existing themes, plugins and widgets.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s certainly harder to set up (if you do it yourself!) and has a steeper learning curve than RapidWeaver, where you can take your blog with this version of WP is limited only to your ability, imagination and experience level.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you are looking for a free and flexible tool to fire up your own blog, WP is a solid choice. It&rsquo;s not only free and flexible, but there are just tons of user-created add-ons that you can quickly drop right in to your site. If you get stuck, you&rsquo;re in luck: the web is rife with tips and tutorials and fixes for WordPress. I haven&rsquo;t come across a problem yet for which I couldn&rsquo;t find a ready-made answer online within a few minutes of searching. The user forums are great and instructions are comprehensive. The last thing I&rsquo;ll note is that WordPress could do a better job at explaining the various options available for new users (.org, .com, multi-user, etc.). It took me a while to sort it out. I hope this review helps some readers make an informed choice.</p>
<p>That wraps it up. Next, I&rsquo;ll conclude this series with a final summary comparison of RapidWeaver and WordPress.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->learned<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that Adobe launched a public beta of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Express<!-- raw HTML omitted --> yesterday. It&rsquo;s an online photo editing application with a couple of free Gigabytes of storage. It was first demonstrated <!-- raw HTML omitted -->last September<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty slick. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Picnik<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Splashup<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Snipshot<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Phixr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Preloadr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pixenate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (among other competitors in this crowded field) fare in light of this gorilla-sized competition.</p>
<p>I think Apple should enter the fray. I would think it would be a short leap from iPhoto and .Mac to a great web-based editing and storage solution from Cupertino. I&rsquo;m guessing they wouldn&rsquo;t want to make it Flash-based, though.</p>

<p>Here is the Automator workflow I created: open up Delicious Library, export the book catalog (an XML file) to my desktop, copy the location path of this newly created document to the clipboard, open my browser (Firefox) to the LibraryThing import page, tab to the appropriate form field (I used tabs so it was not relative to browser window location), paste the path from the clipboard into the &lsquo;Upload File&rsquo; field on the LT import page, then use tabs and returns to activate the form and upload the file. Finally, move the exported DeliciousLibrary file to the Trash. Once that&rsquo;s all complete, I threw in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Growl<!-- raw HTML omitted --> notification to let me know it was done.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://forestriver.rocks/2008/03/21/why-arent-more.html">Why aren&#39;t more apps using LinkBack?</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I just read about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LinkBack<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an open source framework sponsored by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nisus Software<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that&rsquo;s been around since 2005. I guess I&rsquo;m a little late to the game, but I thought I&rsquo;d share it in case you&rsquo;ve never heard of it. Right now, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->22 applications<!-- raw HTML omitted --> support it.</p>
<p>LinkBack is best described with an example: Suppose you create a vector graphic in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lineform<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Then, you drag and drop your creation into a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VoodooPad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> document. Later, you realize you need to update the graphic. Since both apps support LinkBack, you double-click the graphic from within VoodooPad, edit it in Lineform (which opens automatically), then save it. Now your embedded VoodooPad graphic is updated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s handy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about what applications I use that support a similar sort of inter-application linking. Let&rsquo;s see. I can open up and edit my iPhoto images in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PhotoShop<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I can use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CSSEdit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TextMate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to directly edit documents on the server with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Transmit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And Adobe CS3 handles cross-application editing of files fairly well (within the Adobe apps, of course). That&rsquo;s all I can think of.</p>
<p>I found two posts relating to the launch of LinkBack from March 2005. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One is from TidBITS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the venerable weekly Mac newsletter that&rsquo;s been around since 1990. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->other is from O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s macdevcenter.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. LinkBack launched with relative optimism. Yet I could not readily find any recent posts, reviews or otherwise about it. So why haven&rsquo;t more developers integrated it into their products? Why only 22 apps after three years? Anybody?</p>
<p>By the way, in the post from macdevcenter.com, the author (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Giles Turnbull<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) pointed out that one can hit ⌘-J while typing a post in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MarsEdit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to open up an external text editor. I did not know that. Now that I do, I&rsquo;ll probably be writing all my posts in TextMate — the TextMate HTML <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bundle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and text abilities are far more robust than MarsEdit. Of course, I could add my own Markup to MarsEdit, but I think it will just be easier (more efficient) to open it up in TextMate. I thought it was pretty cool that I learned a new tip from a three year old post.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Surf-Bit&rsquo;s Mac ReviewCast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> episode, host Tim Verpoorten interviewed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Evernote<!-- raw HTML omitted --> CEO Phil Libin. Evernote is a multi-platform application in Beta (invitation only) that &ldquo;allows individuals to capture and find anything from their real and digital lives using their PC, Mac, mobile phone, and the web.

<p>I should clarify this a bit. A stand-alone desktop version of Evernote is free to download by anyone (right now, there are Mac, PC, and Windows Mobile versions available). The Beta invitation is for the web application (and the seamless synching between all your devices).</p>
<p>The most interesting (amazing) feat that Evernote performs? The uncanny ability to read and index text from photos that you&rsquo;ve taken (handwritten notes and printed text within graphics). You have to see this to believe it. Check out Evernote&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->video overview<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;d like to know how it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>At any rate, Libin offered up 1,000 Beta invites for MacReviewCast listeners at the end of the interview. I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->signed up<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and just received my invitation from the developer. I&rsquo;ll share my impressions once I test it out. If it&rsquo;s too late to get an invite from the Mac ReviewCast, you can sign up to try the Beta at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Evernote.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (the developer is issuing new invites as spaces open up).</p>

			 <p>Delicious Library (DL) and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LibraryThing (LT)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> book catalogs. It&rsquo;s really not &lsquo;synching:&rsquo; LibraryThing can &lsquo;synch&rsquo; only in the sense that it can compare a DL book catalog (desktop app) with the LT book catalog (web-based app) so that only new entries are imported. In other words, you can add new DL books to your LT account, but I&rsquo;m not aware of a way to synch your new LT books back to your DL database. I should note that LibraryThing accepts more than just Delicious Library info. It can import from a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wide variety<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of other web-based and desktop apps.</p>
<p>All things considered, I have to say that LibraryThing serves up a pretty good universal import tool (they call it, appropriately, the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Universal Import<!-- raw HTML omitted -->').</p>
<p>In order to save some time, I think it would be nice to automate this process. I started down this road after reader <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->brab<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> asked if synching between the two services was possible. I originally responded that it wasn&rsquo;t possible, only to discover that LibraryThing can, in fact, import with gusto. I should have read the manual!</p>
<p>Then it dawned on me that this is an ideal <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Automator<!-- raw HTML omitted --> scenario: create a workflow to expedite the process of exporting Delicious Library book catalog to LibraryThing. LibraryThing accepts DL exported data, so it should be easy, right? Two hours later, and I am ready to punch the little Automator robot.</p>
<p>While I used Automator quite often in Tiger, this was my first use in Leopard. I don&rsquo;t know if I was just tired (and I&rsquo;ll try again later to see if it was me) but I did not have a pleasant experience. Automator was very quirky: the steps I created in the process worked great, at first. Then, when I saved my workflow as an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->application<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, it suddenly did not work at all.</p>
<p>So, I opened up the automator process as a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->workflow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> again to troubleshoot, only to discover that my workflow <!-- raw HTML omitted -->no longer worked<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. My main problem: I exported a .txt file from Delicious Library to the desktop. Then I moved that file to my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->/Documents<!-- raw HTML omitted --> folder. Then I copied that path. Then I opened up the browser to the LibraryThings import page to paste that copied path. The problem is that Automator insisted that there was an error with copying my file from the desktop to the new location. And Automator had issues with deleting the file from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->/Documents<!-- raw HTML omitted --> folder once I was done with it. I encountered these errors even though the process worked just fine an hour earlier, and despite the fact that I had changed nothing. I was (and am) pulling my hair out. I checked the permissions of this folder, and they are correct.</p>
<p>I then re-created the entire workflow from scratch; still, I could not get it to work again. Sigh. This is just a simple script to export an text file from DL, copy the file name, and paste the file path into the LT web form for import. It shouldn&rsquo;t take more than a few minutes.</p>
<p>To recap, here is the workflow in a nutshell: open DL, export the book catalog to a desired location (my desktop), move that file to new location (my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->/Documents<!-- raw HTML omitted --> folder), copy the new location path to the clipboard, open my browser to the LT import page, tab to the appropriate form field (I used tabs so it was not relative to browser window location), paste the path from the clipboard into the &lsquo;Upload File&rsquo; field on the LT import page, then use tabs and returns to activate the form and upload the file. For the last step, I deleted the exported DL file from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->/Documents<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Pretty simple, or so I thought. But Automator does not like my workflow. I&rsquo;ll have to try again when I have time&hellip;chances are that it&rsquo;s human error. Still, I&rsquo;m struck by the fact that I had a working automation an hour ago. Now, an hour later, the same workflow is broken. It&rsquo;s very odd. My conclusion: Automator is billed as a tool to bring automation to &lsquo;the rest of us.&rsquo; In general, I think it hits this target: it&rsquo;s easy to use and powerful. Yet, I would like to see better hints when an error occurs. For my problem, all I am told is that there is an error with a step in the process. I don&rsquo;t see any logging information to help me pinpoint why or where that error is occurring.</p>
<p>At any rate, once I get a working Automator workflow I&rsquo;ll post it in case anyone would like to modify it for his/her use. If I can&rsquo;t get it to work, I plan to find some Automator user forums to post my workflow. Perhaps then I&rsquo;ll locate the problem.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Realmac&rsquo;s RapidWeaver<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,
a Mac-only web publishing tool.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iWeb<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (and other CMS solutions), RW is built around the assumption that it&rsquo;s desirable to start out with well-built, professionally-designed, battle-tested templates. This is desirable because (a) most people don&rsquo;t have the time, inclination or ability to produce a site design and (b) templates help ensure that sites meet web standards.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve just labeled a &lsquo;template&rsquo; in the previous paragraph, RapidWeaver calls a &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->theme<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rsquo; What&rsquo;s the difference? Themes are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->flexible<!-- raw HTML omitted --> templates. For most blogging tools or content management platforms, a user will find a theme he or she likes, apply it to their site and that&rsquo;s pretty much it. The average user may change some basic colors and fonts for a given template, but they typically don&rsquo;t have the ability or the inclination to readily modify much else. A RapidWeaver <!-- raw HTML omitted -->theme<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, on the other hand, empowers the user to really dig in and modify the template to make it his or her own.</p>
<p>For the novice, themes may be the killer feature of this program. With themes, some of the style variables that may be modified with ease include site colors, font families, page width (to include flexible and fixed width options within one theme), header image, and sidebar position. Most themes also offer several pre-defined styles from which you can choose as well, which is nice for those who have trouble picking complimentary colors or matching thematic elements.</p>
<p>The customization parameters of a theme are really only limited by how many options the theme developer builds into it. RapidWeaver comes with a slew of nice themes. If you don&rsquo;t find what you like within these options, there are many top-notch <!-- raw HTML omitted -->third-party themes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> available (most will cost you around ten dollars or so, but many are free).</p>
<p>While most people will use a pre-designed theme, the RealMac developers provide a great <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tutorial and a software development kit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for those who wish to create their own (for their own use, to give away, or to sell). Note for those of you who are interested in creating a theme: RapidWeaver works this magic by saving theme variables within an Apple property list (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->plist<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) file. It&rsquo;s a standard XML file, which makes it a breeze to add to and modify theme properties.</p>
<p>Conceptually speaking, RapidWeaver places the design and management of your site in the background so you can concentrate on content, content, content. But that&rsquo;s not to say that it doesn&rsquo;t offer robust design/management tools. On the contrary, the app provides very effective management and customization tools, support for search engine optimization and advanced-user options (such as adding your own java, PHP, special assets, or custom CSS on a per-page or site-wide basis). Most of the configuration and customization options are deployed through a plethora of tabbed pop-up windows (commonly referred to as &lsquo;inspectors&rsquo; in Mac parlance). You open them up when you need them; otherwise, you close them up and they stay out of your way.</p>
<p>All things considered, the developers have created a clean interface to manage just about all aspects of a site — which will especially appeal to those new to web development. The idea is that you won&rsquo;t ever need to get at the code behind the scenes (if you don&rsquo;t want to, that is). RW is so confident that most users will never have to mess with underlying code that the developers don&rsquo;t even present an option to view the code through the application&rsquo;s user interface (<!-- raw HTML omitted --> actually, they used to have an option to view the code in earlier versions of the program, but no longer do. This was a good choice because the displayed code in the earlier versions was not directly editable. That was just annoying<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). Not to worry though — you can get to the code if you need to. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->UPDATE<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I&rsquo;ve learned from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RW forums<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can still<!-- raw HTML omitted --> toggle the code view by invoking the shortcut ⌘-Alt-U.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re used to directly editing style sheets and web code, you may find the &lsquo;RapidWeaver method&rsquo; a little awkward and limiting; the developers took many of the common things you would normally do &lsquo;under the hood&rsquo; and gave them their own front-end user interface. If you&rsquo;ve never hand-coded anything, no need to worry: RW&rsquo;s built-in tools allow even the most novice user to jump right in and start modifying site colors, fonts, sidebar position, site metadata, etc. without ever needing to access the code. There are also some third-party tools you can buy to help you access images for easy modification (see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RWmultitool<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). Alternatively, you can modify a theme by locating it&rsquo;s associated package at <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->/Your User Account/Library/Application Support/RapidWeaver/<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> and opening up the associated HTML and CSS files in the editor of your choice</p>
<p> </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The core of this editing area (the main place where you add your content) is the RW <!-- raw HTML omitted -->page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You can add a variety of pages, ranging from a fully-featured blog to straight HTML code. Each page type you choose defines how you add content to that element. If you choose to create a blog page, for instance, the content area is specialized with fields unique to things you need to add for blog entries. Makes sense. If you choose a photo album page, you get a totally different content area, specialized for iPhoto integration and drag-and-drop simplicity. The designers have obviously put a lot of thought into creating simple interfaces for a wide variety of page types. Chances are that you will not need to refer to the manual very often, except when it comes to understanding all of the options in the RW Inspector panes. That is, each page type is associated with a specific inspector pane, and each inspector pane is chock full of customization options.</p>
<p>While this equates to a platform that allows users to quickly and easily deploy a site, there is a downside. Since RW makes it so easy to publish a site, many users won&rsquo;t bother to (or won&rsquo;t know that they should) fill in site metadata and other details. I have a suggestion for the RealMac developers: it it would be a good idea to provide some tooltips or otherwise-integrated instructions to better explain the myriad customization options available for each page type, the page inspector, and the site inspector.</p>
<p>For example, it&rsquo;s very quick and easy to create a page. However, it may not be readily apparent to users with no web design experience that you also need to name the folder and file for that page. It would be helpful if the developers built in some sort of warning message when users hit the &lsquo;Publish&rsquo; button as a heads up that some of the parameters have not yet been defined.</p>
<p>In the example above, for instance, a helpful message might say &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wait! Before you publish your site, you should name your folders and files for the pages you&rsquo;ve created. This is an important step that will make your site easier to index by search engines. It&rsquo;s also necessary for blog entries so your permalinks are meaningful.'<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Or something like that&hellip;</p>
<p>There are many other examples of instances where tips and other helpful messages would be helpful to ensure the site is properly set up. Imagine you&rsquo;ve never published a website before. You may wonder: What&rsquo;s a meta tag? Why should I worry about this meta stuff? What&rsquo;s &lsquo;page expiration?&rsquo; What&rsquo;s the difference between optimized, tidied, and default code? And so on. I think the program would really benefit from some additional cues to help users along. This, of course, assumes that most people won&rsquo;t read the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->manual<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or dig into the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->forums<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I think that&rsquo;s a safe assumption, especially for an app that draws so many people with little knowledge of these things <!-- raw HTML omitted -->precisely because it&rsquo;s supposed to be so simple to use<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you want comments on your blog posts, you need to sign up for this service. And if you sign up for this service, you can manage your comments via HaloScan&rsquo;s web-based interface. You don&rsquo;t need to be at home to do that.</p>
<p>The other exception? You can buy a third-party blog plugin called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RapidBlog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Loghound.com. RapidBlog is basically a front-end for Google&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blogger<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that seamlessly integrates into RapidWeaver. Using it requires you to sign up for a Blogger account. The only weird thing about it is that your posts will appear both on your website and on your newly-created Blogger site (you can choose to hide your Blogger posts, or you can just leave them there — who knows, it may generate more readership for your primary site). If you use RapidBlog, you can remotely edit your posts or email a post from a remote location.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In my opinion, you need to buy some third-party plugins to really get the most out of this application. And one thing I really ike about RW is how well it integrates with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->third-party plugins, add-ons and themes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I mentioned earlier that the RealMac team offers a SDK for themes. Well, they also offer a SDK for anyone who wishes to try their hand at creating a plugin as well. What fun. True, there are many, many great third-party themes out there. But there are also some killer plugins.</p>
<p>Two complaints I&rsquo;ve heard from RW users is that (a) some plugins should be part of the application from the start and (b) the cost of the plugins quickly exceeds the costs of a RW license. My view? There are some plugins that are so essential, I wouldn&rsquo;t consider RW complete without them. They are just too handy to pass up. I could complain that RealMac should include some of these plugins as core parts of the application, but I honestly don&rsquo;t mind paying for some third-party extended options (note that most of these plugins are different <!-- raw HTML omitted -->page types<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, each with their own Inspector pane full of options and choices). The app is still quite cost-effective, and it&rsquo;s definitely generating some very great third-party software development.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What&rsquo;s not to like? Well, as I mentioned, a case can be made that RW is feature-weak and not powerful enough, evidenced by all of the third-party plugins. Do you really need these plugins? No, but they will make life easier for you and they are pretty cool. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the RealMac team bought out a few of the add-ons in the future. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yourhead Blocks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for instance, adds <!-- raw HTML omitted --> WYSIWYG<!-- raw HTML omitted --> freeform layout functionality to RapidWeaver. I know that my wife, for one, could not live without it for her site. She&rsquo;s so used to using Blocks, in fact, that she forgot that it&rsquo;s not actually a part of RW.</p>
<p>Speaking of my wife, I quizzed her on her RW experience as she&rsquo;s the primary user of the app in our household. She reports that the program is, on the whole, a great tool. However, she has faced some problems with the app crashing while she&rsquo;s trying to publish changes to her site. She&rsquo;s taken to closing down all other running programs on the Mac when she&rsquo;s uploading content, which she says helps. She also notes that publishing times can be quite slow, and the site itself is pretty slow on the initial load. These issues have gotten worse as her site has grown. It raises the question of scalability. How big can a RW file get before it becomes unreliable? I trust the developers will keep refining the loading/publishing issues as development moves forth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve personally noticed that RW can be limiting when it comes to adding or creating complex mixed content on a page. In addition, some things are tricky to do if you want to push the boundaries of a theme or mix up how your content is presented. I can best explain what I&rsquo;m talking about here by way of example. Say you want to add a third column to only one page of a site. This isn&rsquo;t so easy. One solution that many people use is to add a &lsquo;faux&rsquo; column on a Blocks page. That works, but it would be nice to have some themes with one, two, or no column options per page. I&rsquo;m not aware of any limitations that would prevent this.</p>
<p>As for mixed content, I&rsquo;m referring to the ability to, say, mix in some static content with posts. For example, imagine you want your home page to list your top three newest posts. Above and below this, you wish to add some static content — but you still want your main blog to be a separate page in your site. This isn&rsquo;t easy to do. Or imagine that you want to add two columns of static text and maybe some sort of additional javascript to go with your Photo Album page. There are work-arounds to issues such as these (and most rely on third-party plugins!), but I would like to see RealMac push towards more and more flexibility and more choices in the future when it comes to page customization (mixing multiple page types on one page, for example). I&rsquo;d also like a way to open up the core theme files from within the application for quick edits. Of course, that&rsquo;s a tall order since they are also trying to keep things simple with this app. My suggestion? How about two versions set at two different price points: RapidWeaver Standard and Pro?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll close by noting that it&rsquo;s a tool that certainly rewards the patient user — I mentioned that RW has a good user forum, and this is where you should head first to answer any questions you have, or to see if anyone has already posted a fix for a vexing problem you may be having. It&rsquo;s a vibrant, friendly community and if you have an issue, chances are it&rsquo;s already being discussed.</p>
<p>For the next installment in this series, I&rsquo;ll present an overview of Wordpress. Then, in the final post, I&rsquo;ll compare the two based on some criteria of my invention. Cheers.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Postscript<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: A forgot to mention Snippets! This is one of the coolest parts of RapidWeaver. This is a simple but powerful feature: open up your Snippets inspector pane to reveal stored bits of code. Drag and drop these &lsquo;snippets&rsquo; directly onto your page. RapidWeaver includes many handy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->snippetized<!-- raw HTML omitted --> code bits, you can easily create your own, or you can download third party snippets from the RW site. If you find yourself typing bits of code over and over, this can be a huge time saver. Added to that, many people are integrating snippets functionality to create unique add-ons. For example, I just used Snippets yesterday to place <!-- raw HTML omitted -->social bookmarks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my wife&rsquo;s blog. I works great. By the way, if you use the social bookmark snippet referenced here, be sure to check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this thread<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the RW forums. Happy weaving.</p>

			 <p>Thanks to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Analytics<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I&rsquo;ve discovered that many people reach this site upon searching for &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->RapidWeaver<!-- raw HTML omitted --> vs <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rsquo; I offer my apologies if you are one of these people: I posted some short comments on this topic last November, promising to follow up with a complete comparison&hellip;but I&rsquo;m only getting to it now. Why the long delay? I&rsquo;ve needed this gestation period to think about what I wanted to say.</p>
<p>Comparisons of these two publishing platforms are scarce (my proof: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it&rsquo;s the only search term that I&rsquo;m aware of for which this blog appears near the top of the charts on Google<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>Perhaps this is because they are quite different tools. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because review sites, in general, don&rsquo;t offer much in terms of application comparisons.</p>
<p>At first glance, it appears that WP and RW serve different audiences. WordPress is specialized for blogging; RapidWeaver does blogging too, but it&rsquo;s more of a complete website design tool. WordPress offers web-based content management (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->server-side<!-- raw HTML omitted -->); RapidWeaver is managed locally, from the user&rsquo;s computer (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->client-side<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). WP is a free, open-source tool. RW is an application that costs money.</p>
<p>Should they be compared? I think so. That so many people have searched for comparisons of the two to reach this site is a testament to this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used both WordPress and RapidWeaver to develop many sites. Despite their apparent differences, I&rsquo;ve found that both platforms can do just about anything I want them to do when I need to develop a personal (or even small business) site. Both offer great blogging support. Both can handle static/mixed content. Both can be used to create complex, great looking sites for people with little to no web development experience. Yet, these tools remain radically different in many ways. What differentiates the two? Which is best?</p>
<p>I want to start by defining the problem. What are people looking for when they seek a comparison of RW and WP?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my best guess:</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the market for a good, inexpensive tool to create a website. You want your site to be flexible, easy to use and easy to maintain. You want it to look like it was designed by a professional, but you don&rsquo;t have the time, inclination, or experience to create something from scratch. Still, you&rsquo;d like to be able to customize your site with relative ease. Moreover, you want the ability to create, tweak and modify at will, should you decide you want to &lsquo;get under the hood&rsquo; at some point in the future.</p>
<p>You want to start a blog, but you also want a system that easily allows you to add static content. You want lots of template and plugin options to expand the functionality and appeal of your site. You want a platform that is powerful, but you don&rsquo;t want to be overloaded with options. You abhor the notion of navigating a complex user interface. You abhor the notion of reading a long user manual even more. Most of all, you want your site to look beautiful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve searched the web and are overwhelmed by the many choices out there from which to choose. You want to make the right choice the first time. You look at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blogger<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and other basic web-based personal blogging solutions, but you think these are a bit too simplistic. You want something more robust. So you look at open source Content Management System solutions like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Drupal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joomla<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but these solutions are just too complex for your needs. You consider <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DreamWeaver<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but it&rsquo;s too expensive, bloated and complicated. You try <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iWeb<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but it doesn&rsquo;t quite fit the bill. It&rsquo;s nice, but you feel that it&rsquo;s just a bit too limited, too tied to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.Mac<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and perhaps tries so hard to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->drag-and-drop<!-- raw HTML omitted --> simple that you worry that it may limit your future options as your site (and your experience) grows.</p>
<p>Enter RapidWeaver or WordPress. Both platforms are very popular. Both have dedicated, passionate users and solid documentation. Both are capable of producing great looking sites and offer the flexibility and ease-of-use you seek. Both offer tons of great-looking templates and plugins.</p>
<p>For my next post, I&rsquo;ll start the comparison with an overview of each publishing platform. I&rsquo;ll follow this up with a post on the strengths and weaknesses of each. Finally, I&rsquo;ll offer my opinions and conclusions about which tool I think is best for which type of user. If you have any specific issues, needs or considerations you&rsquo;d like to see addressed in this comparison, let me know.</p>

			 <p>So, here&rsquo;s my latest Dvorak-Qwerty keyboard support rant.</p>
<p>I received a very odd &lsquo;personal&rsquo; response from an Adobe customer support representative regarding my request for Dvorak-Qwerty support for Adobe&rsquo;s Creative Suite applications.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My complaint<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Dvorak-Qwerty does not properly work with Adobe products.</p>
<p>(See my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->previous post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for background on DQ if you have no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s a snippet from what I wrote to Adobe about this annoying problem<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We need to inform you that Adobe® Systems continually develops new applications and improves existing products, but cannot comment on unreleased products until a press release is posted. When new releases become available, the details regarding new features and purchasing information will be posted on the Adobe Web site at the following URL: <a href="http://www.adobe.com">www.adobe.com</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Ok. So they seem to grasp the issue, but then again &hellip; the response mimicked the phrases from my complaint so closely that it left me with the distinct impression that some sort of AI compiled and regurgitated a customized automated response based on my input. The part that annoys me most is that the automated response tries too hard to appear like it came from a real human. Or perhaps what annoys me is that it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it came from a real human, but Adobe would like me to feel as if it did.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that I expect to see a software update from Adobe that addresses my issue anytime soon. I&rsquo;m guessing there aren&rsquo;t too many users out there who suffer from lousy DQ support (and it&rsquo;s not just Adobe products that lack DQ support), and I&rsquo;m assuming that the Adobe user base is so massive and the number of suggestions to improve their software are so many that my little complaint may be backlogged until Adobe CS 10.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice that Adobe has a system in place to so quickly respond to a customer input. I bet a lot of R&amp;D went into this auto-rapid-super-friendly-personalized response system. Still, it raises a larger philosophical question about automated, rapid customer support. Is a quick reply better than a delayed reply (or no reply at all) if it is canned and impersonal? Is it actually worse if it&rsquo;s canned and impersonal and it attempts to be personalized in a very fake way?</p>
<p>In addition to the mimicry of my original complaint, the &lsquo;personal&rsquo; message also included my name at awkward intervals throughout the response. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Adobe response was signed by &lsquo;Victor M.&rsquo; of Adobe Customer Service. I&rsquo;m sure that Victor M. exists, but he surely would not have typed out such a weird response to a customer. I really wouldn&rsquo;t expect a human to type out a detailed response within 24 hours from such a massive company. It had to be a generated response. So what&rsquo;s my point? If Adobe is committed to a personalized, rapid customer response, I would rather receive a message that said:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If any of you reading this are Dvorak typists who use QWERTY shortcuts (and use Adobe apps), please consider dropping them a note. Maybe all ten of us will get them to consider updating their software&hellip;</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been off the grid for the past several days getting ready for a job interview. Now that it&rsquo;s over, I want to share a tip about a tool I used to help me prepare.</p>
<p>First, I&rsquo;ll define the problem. I typically prepare for an interview by writing out potential questions that may be asked. I then add some &lsquo;answers&rsquo; after each question in a bulleted list. I then sit in front of my Mac and practice answering my fictitous questions. This works fairly well — and I own several programs that handle simple bulleted lists with flair (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pages<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tinderbox<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniOutliner<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for instance).</p>
<p>But I wanted something a little different this time around. Instead of viewing my questions and answers all on one page, I wanted the ability to view my questions separately from my answers. In other words, I wanted to see the questions without the &lsquo;answer&rsquo; bullet points. Then, after I practiced responding to the question, I wanted to compare what I said with the bullet points. It dawned on me that what I was looking for was a simple &lsquo;flash card&rsquo; system.</p>
<p>Enter <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VoodooPad<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you&rsquo;ve never used this tool, it&rsquo;s worth trying out (especially considering that the developers offer a free <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lite version<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that is surprisingly capable and feature-rich). What is it? Essentially, it&rsquo;s a tool for taking freeform notes that gives you the power to quickly and easily create links to new pages of information. It&rsquo;s like having a little stand-alone I&rsquo;ve previously noted that VoodooPad is a nice tool for fiction. Create a character sketch for a person named &lsquo;Tim,&rsquo; for example, then link this character information to a sub-page named &lsquo;Tim.&rsquo; Once you create this sub-page, every time you type the name &lsquo;Tim,&rsquo; VoodooPad automatically links this character name to the character sketch sub-page. It&rsquo;s a handy way to track and develop people, places, and things when writing a story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a handy way to create hypertext fiction. It&rsquo;s certainly not as robust as Eastgate&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->StorySpace<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but it&rsquo;s a heck of a lot cheaper. StorySpace is $295 (to be fair, StorySpace is a very specialized writing tool designed for very long and complicated hypertext stories). My point is that VoodooPad Lite is free and does a fine job if you&rsquo;re looking for a simple tool to try out non-linear writing.</p>
<p>VoodooPad works very well as a &lsquo;flash card&rsquo; system, too. It was the perfect tool, in fact, to help me practice for my interview. All I had to do was type out a question, create a new link to it and paste my bullet points for that question in my newly created sub-page. I listed all of my practice interview questions on my main &lsquo;index&rsquo; page and linked to sub-pages for each answer. I also created some links to hold background information about the job for quick reference. My interview &lsquo;prep package&rsquo; was easy to set up. It was convenient to have all my interview notes contained within one little stand-alone VoodooPad file.</p>
<p>VoodooPad comes in three different flavors depending on your needs. I&rsquo;m currently getting by with the free <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lite<!-- raw HTML omitted --> version, but I&rsquo;m getting ready to upgrade. Why? I&rsquo;ve come to depend on it. And I keep finding new ways to use it. This is not to say that I find the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lite<!-- raw HTML omitted --> version of this app lacking for my simple needs — it&rsquo;s more about supporting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flying Meat<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (the developers).</p>
<p>I could have written that last sentence differently, but I may never get the chance to use the phrase <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;supporting Flying Meat<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; again&hellip;</p>

			<h1><a href="https://forestriver.rocks/2008/02/26/back-to-basics.html">Back to Basics: Top Nine tips for new Mac users</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://forestriver.rocks/2008/02/26/back-to-basics.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2008-02-26 04:41:45 -0500">Feb 26, 2008</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This is my first post in a new category I&rsquo;m calling &lsquo;back to basics.&rsquo; With all the new Mac users out there, I&rsquo;ve decided to periodically post some tips aimed at this crowd — a group that includes many of my friends who&rsquo;ve crossed over from the PC. To get the ball rolling, I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of nine tips for new Mac users. If you have a tip to share, leave a comment to round off this list at an even ten.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s about more than learning the differences between a &lsquo;Dock&rsquo; and a &lsquo;Start&rsquo; menu, or &lsquo;System Preferences&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Control Panel&rsquo; — understanding Mac OS X is about changing the way you think about using your computer. While built-in Mac OS X &lsquo;help files&rsquo; are available to answer basic questions, it&rsquo;s hard for new users to get the big picture through help files alone. This documentation tends to be short and is often devoid of context.</p>
<p>For those new to the Mac, I think it&rsquo;s worth the money and effort to buy a third-party manual to keep at hand for quick and easy reference. A book offers depth, context, and examples in a package that won&rsquo;t get in your way while you&rsquo;re working on your Mac. Sure, you can find just about anything you want to know through an online search or user forums, but a well-written book will help you break your PC habits and more quickly adapt to the Mac environment. Maybe I&rsquo;m old fashioned, but I think it&rsquo;s generally easier to learn from a book. You can prop it open to a dog-eared page, highlight it, tab it with stickies, and generally abuse it. Most importantly, you don&rsquo;t need to navigate away from what your doing to get some help.</p>
<p>I recommend David Pogue&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac OS X Leopard: The Missing Manual<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I also like TidBIT&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TakeControl<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Ebooks, a series of downloadable PDF booklets that are cheap and full of great info (you can print them out or view them online). If you are a more visual type of person and want to learn how to use your Mac (and many great applications) by watching videos, be sure to check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ScreenCastsOnline<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Apple also offers some good online resources. Be sure to check out Apple&rsquo;s online help files: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Switch 101<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac 101<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Find Out How<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rsquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve discovered that many ex-PC users fret about downloading software from third-party sites because they fear viruses, trojans, spyware, and other nasty stuff. All I can say is that Mac apps are generally very safe (by &lsquo;generally&rsquo; I mean that there have been no viruses, trojans, spyware, etc. thus far embedded in third-party Mac software that I am aware of, but it won&rsquo;t necessarily stay that way)&hellip; and users who ignore third-party Mac apps are arguably missing out on the best part of the Mac experience. The key is to only use trusted sources as you seek out new apps. A few trusted sources I use are: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MacUpdate<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->versiontracker<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iusethis<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Need a way to keep your applications up to date? Try MetaQuark&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AppFresh<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->*<!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I personally use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Launchbar<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but it isn&rsquo;t free)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>By way of example, a friend of mine downloaded Handbrake one night based on my recommendation to format/convert some of his DVDs to use on his new iPhone. The next day, he complained that the app was extremely slow and created a &lsquo;blank&rsquo; file that didn&rsquo;t open up in any application. The problem? He was running Handbrake from within the disk image. He didn&rsquo;t realize he needed to drag it to his applications folder prior to using it. It&rsquo;s easy for long-time Mac users to laugh at this mistake, but consider it from my friend&rsquo;s perspective. How would he know?</p>
<p>But what about deleting? If you don&rsquo;t want an application anymore, drag it the trash. That&rsquo;s it. You&rsquo;re done. Use the same method to delete files. Want to delete things even faster? Try this key combo: ?-delete. If you want to keep you Mac as tidy as possible, consider the free <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AppDelete<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or the shareware <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AppZapper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. These apps clean out additional items that are left behind when you drag apps to the trash. Not that these additional items will hurt anything if you leave them — it generally doesn&rsquo;t really matter much. Still, it&rsquo;s a good practice to delete all the associated bits and scraps of a program when you&rsquo;re done with it. Down the road, you&rsquo;ll be glad you did.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Most importantly, &lsquo;Get Info&rsquo; is where you&rsquo;ll find permissions that govern who can do what with your files (you decide who can Read, Write, and Execute). Need a tutorial? Check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this Macworld article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple documentation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But there&rsquo;s a better way. Longtime Mac users tend to be oddly fanatical about shortcut keys, and Mac applications reflect this: each Mac application you install will have a seemingly endless list of shortcuts. Why bother learning key-combo shortcuts? Speed and efficiency are clear benefits, but shortcuts also help you avoid repetitive stress from using the Mouse.</p>
<p>Here are a just a few you shortcuts you should consider learning right away:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With Mac OS X, there are easier ways to navigate. Try the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Expose<!-- raw HTML omitted --> keys. Try <!-- raw HTML omitted -->?-tab<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (tab through open applications). Try <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spaces<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Try some of the great Mac application launchers (see #8 above). Use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spotlight<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The last one I&rsquo;ll point out here is a little freeware preference pane to toggle between open windows within one application with ease — it&rsquo;s called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Witch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and it&rsquo;s made by the same guy who created Butler.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Check out Apple&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac Maintenance Quick Assist<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, how to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->manually<!-- raw HTML omitted --> initiate maintenance tasks, and Macworld&rsquo;s dated but still very relevant article on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->preventing Mac disasters<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You may also want to consider investing in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cocktail<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s not free, but it&rsquo;s cheap, simple to use, helpful, and is an excellent maintenance Mac app. New Mac users should also consider the expensive but essential <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DiskWarrior<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You may not need it often, but when you do need it &hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you really need it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>My last point: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reboot<!-- raw HTML omitted --> every now and then. My father-in-law recently visited with his Macbook in tow. He complained that some of his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniWeb<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->*<!-- raw HTML omitted --> links were no longer working and his machine was generally acting strange. When I opened up his laptop, it whirred to life. When I say &lsquo;whirred,&rsquo; I mean it was really noisy. Fans were blowing hard. Hard drive was cranking. My solution? I rebooted. Everything worked fine after that. It was silent once more. It turned out he had the computer in sleep mode for over half a year — since his last visit he had never rebooted. A system reboot at least once a month is a good way to clear out any weird or corrupt processes that may be running.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->*<!-- raw HTML omitted -->(stay tuned for a future post on why I bought OmniWeb for my father-in-law)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>How far you take it depends on how adventurous you are, but even the most conservative of users should try out a bit of customization. It&rsquo;s your Mac, after all.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one small <!-- raw HTML omitted -->example<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Here&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->another<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Here&rsquo;s yet <!-- raw HTML omitted -->another<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. A good starting point to see how fun and
useful this can be is the free <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tinkertool<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Marcel Bresink. The list is endless - explore forums, Mac sites, etc. and enjoy. Be careful though. It can be addicting.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This first account is the one to use on a daily basis. With your <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Standard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> account, you will be prompted to enter your Admin account name and password every time you install new software, change system preferences, etc. It&rsquo;s a bit of a pain, but it&rsquo;s a lot more secure. For Leopard users, be sure to check out the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sharing Only<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; account (great choice when you have relatives visiting who want to use your Mac) and &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Managed with Parental Controls<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; (great choice, of course, for kids). Oh, and make a note to ensure that your Mac Firewall is turned on (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->System Preferences &gt; Security &gt; Firewall<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)&hellip;inexplicably, the Firewall is turned off by default for users who upgrade from Tiger to Leopard.</p>
<p>And what if you forget your Admin password? Fortunately, there is an easy fix. All you need to do is stick your OS X installation disk in your CD/DVD drive, restart your computer, and hold down &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; key as it restarts (<!-- raw HTML omitted --> remember this with C = CD-ROM<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). You can let go of the &lsquo;C&rsquo; when you hear your CD/DVD drive whir to life. In time, a window will appear that asks you to select a user language. Then, as the next window pops open, you&rsquo;ll notice that there are now some menu options up in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple menu ba<!-- raw HTML omitted -->r (top of the screen). Choose &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Utilities<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; (if you are running 10.4 Tiger or 10.5 Leopard) or &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Installer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; (for earlier versions of the Mac OS). Then choose &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reset Password<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rsquo; Follow the simple instructions to choose a new password for the account of your choice, then quit the installation process (from the &lsquo;Installer&rsquo; menu in the Menu Bar) and restart your computer without holding down &lsquo;C.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s great that it&rsquo;s so easy to reset an admin password, it&rsquo;s also kind of scary. What it means is that anyone with an installation disc and access to your machine can quite easily reset your admin password and access your files. The moral: if you have data that you don&rsquo;t want anyone to see under any circumstances, you will want to explore ways to encrypt this data and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->protect your mac<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The other important point to make here: ensure you have a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->backup<!-- raw HTML omitted --> before doing this, just in case.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. Have a tip to share?</p>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s a tip for working with text on your Mac. Have you ever needed to copy over the text of an email from, say, Apple Mail to another application (like your blog?). I need to do this all the time.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem. Sometimes I use my lunch break at work to begin typing out a post for this blog (using Microsoft Outlook — I use Windows at work). I then send this Outlook email home. Later that night, I fire up Apple Mail, copy the text of the email, and then paste the text into <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MarsEdit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to form a starting point for a new post.</p>
<p>The problem is that the email text is riddled with annoying line endings. It doesn&rsquo;t wrap correctly.
Here&rsquo;s an example from an earlier <!-- raw HTML omitted -->post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to illustrate the point. I typed up the following text in Outlook and then sent it to Apple Mail several weeks ago. When I cut and paste this text, it looks like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So far, I&rsquo;ve written
about iGTD and OmniFocus, both excellent applications. The &lsquo;Getting
Things Done&rsquo; task manager series is taking more time
than I anticipated,
mainly because it takes a while to really grasp each of these
applications.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
As you can see, the line endings make this block of text look awful. I want the text to wrap naturally so it fits the width of whatever box I place it in. I want it to look like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So far, I&rsquo;ve written about iGTD and OmniFocus, both excellent applications. The &lsquo;Getting Things Done&rsquo; task manager series is taking more time than I anticipated, mainly because it takes a while to really grasp each of these applications.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I won&rsquo;t get into the technical reasons behind this formatting problem. Instead, I&rsquo;ll just show you how to fix it quickly and easily. I trim my line endings with ease using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DevonThink&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> free <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordService<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tool. Download this tiny package, copy the folder over to your Services folder <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(User Account&gt;Library&gt;Services)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and you&rsquo;re in business.</p>
<p>All you need to do is select the text after you paste it into the app of your choice, select &lsquo;Format&rsquo; from your Services menu, and then select &lsquo;Reformat.&rsquo; There it is.</p>
<p>All line endings are removed — and your paragraph structure stays in tact. This is just one of 34 handy tools included in the WordService package. Give it a try (be sure to peruse the included &lsquo;ReadMe&rsquo; text to get a feel for what the different tools do).</p>
<p>Many of the applications you use on your Mac include Services options. Most of them are worth checking out. The nice thing about this Apple tool is that you can invoke an application&rsquo;s &lsquo;service&rsquo; tools even if that application isn&rsquo;t open. For example, suppose you&rsquo;re surfing the web and you find some text or a URL you want to add to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yojimbo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an application I like to use for storing and organizing notes. Simply select some text or a URL, then choose Yojimbo&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Import<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Services<!-- raw HTML omitted --> menu. Presto, Yojimbo launches and the new text or URL is instantly added.</p>
<p>Services, by the way, is mainly designed as a way to work with selections of text. If you want to see a couple of the more interesting things you can do with it, select a bunch of text and try out the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->summarize<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; and &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->speech<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; tools. I&rsquo;m a big Services fan. It&rsquo;s probably one of the least used tools on Mac OS X — and it can be quite useful.</p>

			 <p>If the skies are clear where you live tomorrow night (or tonight, depending on your time zone), don&rsquo;t miss your chance to witness the last <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lunar eclipse<!-- raw HTML omitted --> until Dec. 2010.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Here in Hawaii, I&rsquo;ll be heading out to the beach around 11 p.m. While I won&rsquo;t be bringing my Mac with me, this event marks a great occasion to highlight a few of the astronomy programs available for OS X. These tools are excellent teaching aids and are just plain enjoyable. If you don&rsquo;t have a Mac, no worries: each of these apps run on Mac, Windows, and Linux.</p>
<p>If you go outside to watch for the eclipse, keep an eye out for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Saturn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->if you have a telescope the rings will be visible<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regulus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->the 22nd brightest star in the night sky, in the Leo constellation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>Saturn and Regulus will be the brightest points in the sky nearest to the eclipsed moon. Exactly where they will appear relative to you, of course, will depend on your location and the time you go outside to have a look — but they will appear to be close to the moon.</p>

<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Earth<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Free<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It isn&rsquo;t just for earth-browsing any more. Check out the &lsquo;Sky&rsquo; view mode for a full-featured astronomy package chock full of user-contributed goodness. I&rsquo;ve lost many hours engrossed in the &lsquo;Sky&rsquo; view; this Google Earth expansion is still a pretty new feature, but it keeps getting better and better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Celestia<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Free<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Celestia doesn&rsquo;t confine you to viewing stars from an earth-bound perspective. You are free to fly around the visible universe in dizzying three dimensions. There are many, many <!-- raw HTML omitted -->expansions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> available for Celestia that make it even more fun and valuable as a learning tool. The one thing about Celestia is that it&rsquo;s not quite as easy to use as the other programs; still, it&rsquo;s an amazing tool with a dedicated user base and it&rsquo;s a joy to use.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Starry Night<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Expensive<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I own an old Mac OS 9 version of Starry Night Pro and I still use it on my old iBook G4 in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Classic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> mode (note that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Classic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> only runs on Tiger and earlier versions of Mac OS X). It&rsquo;s come a long way since then and is worth checking out if you really enjoy astronomy and want a feature-rich package with many great animations and photo-realistic imagery. Even the old version of Starry Night that I own is visually very beautiful. It&rsquo;s a great teaching aid to view the solar system in motion from any perspective, watch eclipses, find satellites, view the earth from distant planets, and more. If you go for the Pro package, you can hook up your Mac to your telescope to track distant objects. My only problem with Starry Night is that it seems to have gone overboard a bit with commercialization — there are now at least six SN packages to choose from, and all of them are pricey.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My favorite experience with Starry Night? Heading out in a canoe late at night with my old iBook back in my home state of Maine on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nicatous Lake<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (far, far away from any light pollution), turning on Starry Night&rsquo;s &lsquo;night vision mode&rsquo; and spending a few hours looking up at the sky. Note that this is only enjoyable in the summer while doused with about one gallon of bug spray to keep the mosquitos away.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s an ongoing struggle in my household. I don&rsquo;t want to use any names&hellip;but if it weren&rsquo;t for my tireless, unrelenting efforts to keep my iMac (which is shared by one other person) free of desktop clutter, there would now be a virtual sea of files cluttering our desktop. You might never guess I was an organized person if you happened to open my sock drawer, but I keep the Mac lean and clean. The only icons I prefer to see on my desktop are mounted drives. To be fair, I drive my wife crazy (ok it&rsquo;s my wife, but I won&rsquo;t use her name) with some of my user habits because I can&rsquo;t leave the Mac alone. I&rsquo;m always installing things, deleting things, moving things, changing things &hellip; above all, I like to test out third party mac software.</p>
<p>So, you may ask, why on earth do we share one user account on our primary Mac? It&rsquo;s not the recommended way to do business. The preferred solution is to create separate user accounts; this is more secure and it gives you the freedom to organize your own workspace just how you want it. But I maintain there is at least one scenario when a shared account makes sense — when you have a Mac that always stays at home and you and one other person you completely trust are using it to share the same pool of data.</p>
<p>We share the same music library, the same iPhoto library &hellip; we share pretty much all of our data. For several years, we managed seperate accounts, but I grew weary of constantly dropping and dragging files and folders back and forth. We had iPhoto and iTunes set up for sharing, but this requires one to be logged in to both accounts to access the others shared photo/music content. Much of the mail we receive is for both of us. It just seemed easier to combine the two.</p>
<p>Would I recommend this arrangement? Again, and this is critical: only if you completely trust that one other person and you can live with different user habits on one account. For me and my wife, life is just easier using one account, despite our different organizational styles. I&rsquo;d venture to guess that no one would really recommend this set up, but it&rsquo;s good for us. Here are a few of the ways we make it work. Even if you don&rsquo;t share an account, this list may provide you with some fresh ideas.</p>
<p> </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That&rsquo;s about it. One final note: I recently downloaded the trial for a program called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hazel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from NoodleSoft. This little program automates file organization, manages trash, monitors and organizes folders, and more. It&rsquo;s very clever and quite easy to use. I think this may be a great new tool to help me and my wife manage our shared account.</p>

			 <p>This is a quick note about an experience I recently had with customer support from Agile Web Solutions, the creators of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1Password<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to review this application — there are already hundreds of available online comments and reviews. Suffice it to say that I&rsquo;ve come to depend on 1Password so much that I recently decided to upgrade my family license (good for three Macs) to the Small Business package (good for five Macs).</p>
<p>I emailed the company with my request and received a response within the hour. I was naturally pleased to get such a rapid reply. I was doubly surprised because I sent the request late in the evening from my home in Hawaii; I&rsquo;m accustomed to waiting until the next business day (when North America is awake) for customer service. But that&rsquo;s not the amazing part.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a clip from the message I received from a man named James in Australia, identified as a &lsquo;passionate 1Password user:&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Since the upgrade is not automatic, I have gone ahead and updated your license to a Small Business license and sent it in a separate email. I trust you will make the payment, so I don&rsquo;t want to make you wait.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I then received my license moments later.</p>
<p>This struck me as a particularly generous and trusting thing to do in this day and age, and it was much appreciated. So, I want to thank the 1Password team for the stellar service. This transaction served as a fresh reminder of why I feel like I am part of a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->community<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as a Mac user.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://forestriver.rocks/2008/02/10/year-of-the.html">Year of the Killer Task Management App: Wrap Up</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://forestriver.rocks/2008/02/10/year-of-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2008-02-10 00:59:29 -0500">Feb 10, 2008</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Back in January, I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->predicted<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that 2008 will prove to be the year of the killer task management application for the Mac. Right now, there are dozens of &lsquo;To Do&rsquo; list programs for the Mac&hellip;and OS X Leopard&rsquo;s Mail and iCal now include basic &lsquo;To Do&rsquo; list management. So what&rsquo;s so special about this year?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about GTD. The recent release of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniFocus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the buzz surrounding the pre-release version of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> mark the evolution of some serious competition — and serious refinement — in the field of Mac-based task managers that use ideas and concepts inspired by David Allen&rsquo;s popular &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Things Done<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; workflow.</p>
<p>I just completed a series of in-depth reviews of some of the most popular and promising of this breed of Mac &lsquo;To Do&rsquo; managers, and it may be no surprise to you that OmniFocus and Things look set to lead the pack.</p>
<p>To get the most out of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->View from the Dock<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reviews, I recommend you start by taking a look at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->first post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in this series, in which I set out the criteria I would use to evaluate these applications. I originally intended to review five apps, but I ultimately only reviewed four: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iGTD<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniFocus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Midnight Inbox<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I did not review CoalMarch Park (even though I said I would back in Jan.), because it appears that it’s no longer offered. But that&rsquo;s Ok: I think these four apps are the main contenders in this contest. Which one is the best? Read on.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So here&rsquo;s the countdown:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Midnight Inbox is the only app of this group that reaches out and grabs data on your Mac. It also stands out as the app that most closely follows the GTD workflow. The user interface of Inbox is just beautiful, but the learning curve is a bit steep.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>If you are well-versed in the GTD process and like the idea of an app that clearly walks you through a step-by-step task management process, give it a try. Version 2.0 of Inbox is now in the works.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since the program is well-designed, ties in nicely with other apps (in particular, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->QuickSilver<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and is free, it will likely continue to have a strong following. If you&rsquo;re one of those power users who like lots of options and choices, you may love this. Others may find the user interface a bit cluttered and overwhelming. One thing you will like: many users note that the developer is very responsive and the app is frequently updated. Version 2.0 (an Alpha release) of iGTD is now available for preview.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The user interface is genius: it&rsquo;s clean and sleek — but there is a lot under the hood here once you get comfortable with the workflow. I&rsquo;ve found OmniGroup customer support to be top-notch: quick, responsive, and helpful.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you like the idea of creating your own workflow and don&rsquo;t have a problem with putting in some time to set up a tagging structure that works for you, you may love it. It&rsquo;s still early in the game (as it hasn&rsquo;t even bee
n released yet) but the Beta is great. I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of positive user comments out in the macosphere — and people seem to be genuinely excited about using this app. The trial is available now. Check out the developer&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wiki<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for tutorials and inspiration.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With this in mind, I think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cultured Code Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> stands out as the best bet.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniFocus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a close second and will likely be the app of choice for many business users who have tons of tasks to manage (the higher price of OmniFocus will continue to be a limiting factor). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Midnight Inbox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iGTD<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will surely continue to build upon a stable cadre of dedicated users, but I don&rsquo;t think they will be the breakaway apps that bring sophisticated GTD-based task management to the masses. They are great, but they may be just a little too geeky for some.</p>
<p>I should note, in closing, that this site and these reviews are not sponsored by anybody. I should also add that I am by no means a GTD expert, and that all the reviews here are just my opinions. I really believe that all four of these applications are excellent, well-designed and full of promise. I urge you to try each one out to decide for yourself, and I hope this series will help you get started. Oh, and by the way, &lsquo;GTD&rsquo; and &lsquo;Getting Things Done&rsquo; are registered trademarks of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Allen &amp; Co<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Good luck Getting Things Done!</p>

			 <p>I recently read an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about potential future growth in the iPod market centered around the Wi-Fi mobile platform introduced with the iPod Touch. Now that I have experienced Wi-Fi access in this great little handheld device, I could never go back. This is surely the future of handhelds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on week three with my new Touch, and I have to say I love it. The addition of the Mail, Notes, Maps, and Safari browser is fantastic. It&rsquo;s utterly transformed how I use my iPod. I can&rsquo;t wait to see what the independent Mac software community comes up with to make this even a better device once Apple releases the software development kit later this month.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing that really bugs me about my new iPod: the lack of tactile controls to play, pause, and change songs. With my old 3G iPod, I could plug it into my car stereo and change songs on the fly without looking at it. This isn&rsquo;t possible now, and I&rsquo;m told the iPod remote (with the built-in FM transmitter) doesn&rsquo;t work with the Touch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPod Nano Remote Control<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will work with the iPod Touch, but I mail-ordered a similar low-end remote before for my old iPod and it was cheap and flimsy. In fact, I ended up sending it back because it failed within a week. I need a good remote!</p>
<p>Now, following Apple&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->announcement<!-- raw HTML omitted --> today, there is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one more thing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that bugs me about my Touch. I patiently waited for Macworld before I bought my iPod Touch <!-- raw HTML omitted -->explicitly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to ensure Apple wasn&rsquo;t about to launch an updated version with more memory. I have over 20GB of music alone. Alas, they didn&rsquo;t announce anything new for the iPod line during the Expo, so I happily bought a 16GB model &hellip; confident that the next iPod Touch update would be far in the future (or at least several months away).</p>
<p>Now, less than three weeks after I buy my 16GB model, they announce a 32GB version for $100 more. Apple is surely aware that many people wait for Macworld before plunking down money on a new piece of Mac gear. Couldn&rsquo;t they have announced this a few weeks ago during their biggest consumer show of the year? Perhaps this was a tactic to reduce their 8 and 16GB reserves. Geez. I could really use that extra space. Anyone want to buy a slightly used 16GB iPod Touch?</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is the fifth post in a series comparing <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->task management applications<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> based on the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Things Done<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; process. Today I&rsquo;ll look at Cultured Code&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>For an application that hasn&rsquo;t yet been released, Cultured Code&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is generating a healthy amount of discussion in the Mac community. Why? It&rsquo;s arguably the easiest to use of any of the Mac-based GTD task management systems, it&rsquo;s elegant and the interface is beautiful. It&rsquo;s also the application that is the most loosely-based on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Things Done<!-- raw HTML omitted --> framework.</p>
<p>This all adds up to an application that effectively lowers the entry barrier for those who are interested in exploring the &lsquo;Getting Things Done&rsquo; process, but have been scared away by complex user interfaces or steep learning curves posed by other applications in this field. Things, in other words, conforms to the basic ideas of GTD, but it&rsquo;s flexible enough to allow you to come up with your own unique management system. It&rsquo;s GTD light.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things' is in the Beta stage now — anyone can go and download a free trial that will remain operable until version 1.0 is released this Spring. The current version is at 0.9.6 at the time of this post. You should be aware that the interface and features of the current version are due to change; &lsquo;due to improve&rsquo; would be more accurate.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> While I didn&rsquo;t find too many holes in this pre-release version (and it has been perfectly stable on my installation of OS X Leopard), there are a few features that I&rsquo;d like to see added which I&rsquo;ll highlight at the end of the article. Fortunately, the developers are still adding features and refining the user interface based on user feedback and their own ideas.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Obviously, &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Collect<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; is where you collect things. Like the other GTD-based apps we&rsquo;ve looked at, the collection starting point is the &lsquo;Inbox.&rsquo; This is GTD straight from the tap: the Inbox is where you collect tasks as they pop into your head — where you dump all those nagging things floating around in your brain into a trusted system. Once these items are captured, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about forgetting them anymore. Easy enough.</p>
<p> 
With the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Focus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> section, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> starts to diverge from the other GTD programs we&rsquo;ve reviewed. Think of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Focus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> section as place to view your tasks oriented by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->time<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You can view things you have to do <!-- raw HTML omitted -->today<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, you can see all the stuff that&rsquo;s due &lsquo;other than today&rsquo; (which is labeled &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; in Things), you can see the stuff you&rsquo;ve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->postponed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to a later date, and you can view things you may want to do <!-- raw HTML omitted -->someday<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (with no set time or date).</p>
<p>While <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iGTD<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniFocus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Midnight Inbox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> all offer ways to organize and view tasks using similar terminology and concepts, they tend to emphasize contexts and projects over time/date based views. It&rsquo;s a subtle difference, but it&rsquo;s worth noting.</p>
<p>Within this &lsquo;Focus&rsquo; section, you will likely spend most of your time in the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; view; this is where you get a snapshot of all the tasks you&rsquo;ve accumulated — organized by project and area first, then by date/time within these areas. The &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; view, by the way, reminds me of the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Review<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; category (or sorting option) of the other GTD-based apps. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> does not directly employ the GTD &lsquo;review&rsquo; concept (which emphasizes the value of periodically validating your tasks to ensure you remain on track and on target).</p>
<p>If you want to review your tasks in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, you won&rsquo;t find a specific workflow designed to help you do this. If I understand this correctly, the developers at Cultured Code expect you to use the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; Focus (where you see all of your tasks in one main window) as your go-to place to track and review your tasks on an ongoing basis. Again, it&rsquo;s subtle but significantly different than the others. You can review your items if you want to. If you don&rsquo;t want to, no problem.</p>
<p>Next is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Organize<!-- raw HTML omitted --> section. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> allows you to organize by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Project<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Area<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Project will be immediately obvious to most people and is a core part of the GTD process: a project is a container for a list of tasks that must be completed in order to reach a goal (and the goal here is the name of the Project). For instance, I have a project labeled &lsquo;Sell Honda,&rsquo; and each of the tasks in this project, once completed, will hopefully result in the selling of the Honda. Once the project is done, it&rsquo;s closed out. It&rsquo;s then moved to the &lsquo;Log&rsquo; section of the program, which is called the &lsquo;Archive&rsquo; in other apps. Easy. This isn&rsquo;t really any different than the others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But what about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Area<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? This one is less obvious, and it&rsquo;s not a GTD term as far as I know (but it&rsquo;s an interesting derivative). Think of an area as a project without an end point. I have created &lsquo;Mac maintenance,&rsquo; &lsquo;Home maintenance,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Health &amp; Wellness&rsquo; entries as my Areas of responsibility. For these categories, there is no real &lsquo;completion&rsquo; of a project or end state. I&rsquo;m going to need to manage and complete tasks that fall into these broad categories perpetually (many will be repeating tasks), but the area of interest will always remain relevant and viable. It&rsquo;s an idea that is unique to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — you won&rsquo;t find a similar function in any of the other GTD-based apps.</p>
<p>The main problem (which I quickly discovered using Area of Responsibility function) is that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> offers no solution to schedule repeating tasks, which is something I need to do. For Mac maintenance, for instance, I want to run maintenance scripts using Titanium Software&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Onyx<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on a repeating schedule. However &hellip; I&rsquo;m not too worried about this. This feature will soon be added according to a <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Feb. 4 post on the Cultured Code blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. For now, I&rsquo;m forced to manually re-enter my repeating tasks. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->UPDATE: As of Beta 0.9, Things now supports recurring tasks<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p> 
I forgot to mention one important item: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> also lets you assign tasks to other people. In the screenshot, I&rsquo;ve assigned &lsquo;cleaning the garage&rsquo; to a fictitious person named Saiki. This could be very handy if you are using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to manage a larger project with multiple people, or if you manage several people and want to assign and track tasks for them. For now, it appears that this collaboration tool is still limited to local (non-networked) use only. In the future, Cultured Code plans to add a collaboration across the network to manage multi-user tasking with, presumably, other people that are also using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;ll be curious to see how this will be implemented.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the case of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, tagging can be used to &lsquo;tag&rsquo; how much time you think each task will take, to indicate the type of task, to mark the amount of effort you intend to put into a certain task, to add contexts, etc. It&rsquo;s an open-ended system, and it&rsquo;s entirely up to you to decide how your tasks will be tagged. So, while it appears that contexts were axed in this app, they are really still there &hellip; but only if you choose to add them.</p>
<p>As an example, you can see (in screenshot #5) that I&rsquo;ve added an &lsquo;@&rsquo; tag category with sub-tags for &lsquo;mac,&rsquo; and &lsquo;home&rsquo; (I&rsquo;ve also added a tag for &lsquo;errands&rsquo; which you can&rsquo;t see in the screencast - this is an example of how the tags only appear if they are used. In this example, I&rsquo;ve not yet used the &lsquo;errand&rsquo; tag &hellip; so it doesn&rsquo;t appear). This is an example of the GTD idea of &lsquo;contexts.&rsquo; My context tags are markers I use to filter through all my tasks when I want to see what I have to do based on my current location (at my mac, out running errands, or at home, for instance). Other GTD-based apps also give the user the ability to add user-defined contexts, but Things is the only app that combines contexts together with all the other &lsquo;markers&rsquo; you choose to assign to your tasks.</p>
<p>To see what I mean, take a look at the screenshot here. Note that I&rsquo;ve added a bunch of other tags (in addition to contexts) to help further refine the filtering of my tasks. This is freeform to the extreme: the system you devise can be as complex or as simple as you like. To see how tags can help you filter your tasks, we&rsquo;ll next look at how it all fits together.</p>
<p> </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Over time, my tag list has stabilized — I found it worked best for me to keep the tag list short and manageable. If I didn&rsquo;t do this, I think the filtering power of the tags would be greatly watered down. Next I file my tasks by dragging and dropping them to the appropriate Project or Area (which are also user-created). I can also choose to add tasks to &lsquo;Someday&rsquo; if I want to come back to the task at some undefined future time; or &lsquo;Postponed&rsquo; if I want to keep the task in a &lsquo;hold&rsquo; status until a future date of my choosing. I can also move an item from a project or area to the postponed or someday category, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> provides me a useful little unobtrusive reminder that I have an item in these categories — but the items remain hidden from view unless I want to see them (you can see an example of this in screenshot #3 - look for the line that says &lsquo;1 more someday or postponed&hellip;').</p>
<p>Then I start completing my tasks, selecting items by viewing them in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Focus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> area of the program. Within the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Focus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> section, I may choose &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Today<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; to view what&rsquo;s due to today, &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; to see everything else that&rsquo;s coming up, etc.</p>
<p>But what about the tags? This is the best part of the program in my opinion. Tags appear horizontally across the top of the main program window (again, see screenshot #5). Only tags that are relevant for the given tasks that you&rsquo;re viewing are displayed. To filter tasks using tags, simply click on a tag. To filter tasks by more than one tag, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shift-click<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to select more than one tag. By way of example, say I want to see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->personal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tasks that are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->high<!-- raw HTML omitted --> priority, and can only be done on my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Since I&rsquo;ve already tagged my tasks with certain keywords, I simply select the tags that apply (in this case, &lsquo;personal,&rsquo; &lsquo;Mac,&rsquo; and &lsquo;high&rsquo;). It&rsquo;s a simple and powerful solution. I think tagging offers an easier way to filter tasks than the other GTD-based apps. But there is a catch: with so much flexibility comes responsibility. You have to be willing to put in time and effort to create a system that works for you. Things provides a starting point for you (suggested tags), but it&rsquo;s up to you to make your tags meaningful.</p>
<p>After using the app for a while, I started to develop a tagging system that really worked for me. In my case, I discovered that &lsquo;more was less:&rsquo; I found a sweet spot between too many tags (which can be confusing) and too few (which won&rsquo;t help you sort through your tasks very well). I really like the idea of establishing my own filtering system. If you use tagging in other programs (I rely on it with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yojimbo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), the Things methodology should not be very foreign to you.</p>
<p> 
The last function I should note is the system-wide shortcut that allows you to quickly enter new tasks regardless of what application you are currently using (note that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> must be open for this to work). It&rsquo;s a user-defined shortcut — in my case I use Shift-Control-Space, but you can assign any shortcut combo you like. This is by far the easiest way to enter new data — mainly because you can invoke the shortcut anywhere, and the pop-up window allows you to choose where you want your task to go (which Focus or Organization category). This feature (the ability to easily choose where your task should be filed) is curiously missing when you enter a new task from within the program (there are other options from within the program, but they are not as easy as the quick entry).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There were three items that required me to do a little more reading to fully grasp: first, I was not sure what to make of the term &lsquo;Areas of Responsibility&rsquo; until I read the developer&rsquo;s explanation. Second, while tagging was familiar to me, I felt that I needed some guidance to get some ideas about how to best set up my own tagging structure (the developer provides &lsquo;starter&rsquo; tags, by the way, to help get you going). Third, I couldn&rsquo;t figure out where I was supposed to enter &lsquo;Contexts&rsquo; for my tasks. After I read up on tagging, I figured that out.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Before I go, I would like to point out a few annoyances I found with this program (with the hopes that most will be addressed before <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is released). Here&rsquo;s a rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You can&rsquo;t delete projects once you create them (as far as I can tell)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> You can - see comments below.</li>
<li>Perhaps it&rsquo;s a remnant of my PC days, but I&rsquo;m missing right-click options. There are none; nor is there a right-click menu from the Dock. Minor stuff, but it might broaden the appeal of the application</li>
<li>I would like to have the ability to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->batch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> add tags to tasks (select ten tasks, assign one new tag or change a tag for all ten at once)</li>
<li>In th
e &lsquo;Next&rsquo; view, I would like to see a clearer division between areas, projects, etc. (perhaps with the use of color-coding)</li>
<li>I would like to have the &lsquo;Where do you want to file this&rsquo; option that is present in the quick task entry available when I enter a task from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->within<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the program. The &lsquo;File&rsquo; button located on the bottom of the main window is clumsy. Dragging and dropping each item is inefficient</li>
<li>I would like an automated &lsquo;clean up&rsquo; feature - like what is available in OmniFocus - to sort out my tasks with one click once I&rsquo;ve assigned all the variables</li>
<li>the &lsquo;due today&rsquo; and &lsquo;overdue&rsquo; colors are the same shade of light red. I&rsquo;d like them to be just slightly different so I can differentiate between them at a glance</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> is available now as a preview release. This preview will remain fully functional until version 1.0 ships in the Spring. Once the program ships, a single user license will cost $49. If you find that you like this program, consider signing up for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> newsletter. Cultured Code is offering a 20 percent discount if you subscribe prior to the initial release.</p>
<p>This will be my final GTD-based task manager review. I was going to review <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CoalMarch Park<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but it appears that it&rsquo;s no longer be offered by the company. Besides that, I think I&rsquo;ve hit the four main contenders already with my reviews of OmniFocus, Things, Midnight Inbox, and iGTD. My final post in this series comes next - the wrap up.</p>

			 <p>This is the fourth post in a series comparing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->task management applications<!-- raw HTML omitted --> based on the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Things Done<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; process. Today I&rsquo;ll look at Midnight Beep Softworks' <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Midnight Inbox 1.2.8<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Perhaps more than any other task management application I&rsquo;ve explored to date, Midnight Inbox from Midnight Beep strives to be the single point of entry — the GTD command post — through which you organize your life. Unique to the applications we&rsquo;ve looked at so far, this app is designed to reach out and grab data as it accumulates on your Mac through a clever use of Apple&rsquo;s Spotlight and smart folder technology (it doesn&rsquo;t actually move your data — it just creates an alias).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Out of the box, the app is configured to suck in emails from Apple Mail, files from your desktop, events and &lsquo;to dos&rsquo; from iCal, texts &amp; files from anywhere on your Mac, and shortcuts from Safari. As the program continually gathers all of this stuff together in one place, you periodically must process each item through a pre-defined Midnight Inbox workflow — a workflow which is tightly based on the ideas and concepts of GTD.</p>
<p>I had trouble getting used to this. Why would I want to automatically gather data from various locations on my Mac? That sounds like a lot of extra work.</p>
<p>Eventually, I started to get it. Here&rsquo;s one way to look at it: Midnight Inbox is a Mac-based tool that implements the GTD workflow. It follows, then, that the &lsquo;Collection&rsquo; part of the program is designed to be the dumping grounds for everything in your brain. If your Mac is the epicenter of your busy life (your surrogate brain, in a sense), then Inbox intends to be the meta-filter, the super sorting and processing center, for your surrogate brain. In order to be that center, it needs to collect stuff from your surrogate brain. That makes sense, right?</p>
<p>I think this metaphor holds up fairly well if your daily workflow centers around <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mail<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iCal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, text files, documents, and bookmarks. If you don&rsquo;t store your essential daily work within these programs or files in your work-a-day life, or if you prefer to manually add projects and items as you dream them up, you may find auto-collection a bit too time-intensive and restricting.</p>
<p>I say &lsquo;time intensive&rsquo; because it can take considerable time and effort to process every item that Midnight Inbox sucks in (to be fair, you can adjust how much or little stuff the program draws in). I use &lsquo;restricting&rsquo; here in the sense that Inbox seems designed to function as an implementation of &lsquo;Getting Things Done&rsquo; first, and a general task manager second. That is, it&rsquo;s a program that focuses on implementing the GTD <!-- raw HTML omitted -->process<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I think it does an admirable job at this, but it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that this software implements a very specific workflow.</p>
<p>Those of you who really groove on the GTD process and want a system that tightly follows this model may find this program particularly appealing. Other task management applications <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve looked at<!-- raw HTML omitted --> employ core GTD ideas in various ways, but they tend to offer higher levels of user-defined flexibility. That is, they focus more on providing a flexible framework, and it&rsquo;s up to you to manually enter actions and items — and you can generally move stuff around in a more freeform fashion. Midnight Inbox, on the other hand is, at it&rsquo;s core, more about following a pre-defined task management process.</p>
<p>Which way is better? Surely it will depend on the organizational style of the user. If you just finished reading David Allen&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->book<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, you may really take to this model. I personally prefer the applications that follow more freeform solutions.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p> </p>
<p>The workflow is cleanly broken down into iconic sections, which are stacked in a left-hand column of the application&rsquo;s main window. The first item on this list is the &lsquo;Collect&rsquo; section, which I&rsquo;ve already talked a lot about in previous paragraphs. This is where your collected items gather.</p>
<p>Next is the &lsquo;Process&rsquo; function. At a point of time of your choosing, you process through your collection of items. When you choose to &lsquo;Process Collections,&rsquo; a new dropdown menu pops up that presents you with options for filing each item that you collect.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From this menu, you may make a new project, complete an action immediately (if it&rsquo;s a task you can do in less than two minutes — a GTD concept that is well integrated in this application), or file it away for the future. Curiously, you can&rsquo;t assign a context at this stage (keep reading if you&rsquo;re not sure what a context is). I like how Midnight Inbox handles processing: the dropdown menu is well-ordered, clear, and concise.</p>
<p>Next, you move on to the &lsquo;Organize&rsquo; phase. As you might suspect, this is the stage at which you organize your stuff. Here, you may assign a context to an action, add new actions, add new projects, assign how often you&rsquo;d like to review a given project, etc. Midnight Beep describes the &lsquo;Organize&rsquo; phase as the &lsquo;heart of the Inbox experience.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s the place where, at a glance, you may view and reorganize all of the projects and associated actions you&rsquo;ve gathered. The organization phase focuses on refinement of your projects, categories, and contexts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I should note that you can also choose to add new projects, actions, etc. on the fly here as the need arises (which is essential — auto-collection is not likely to capture everything you need to act upon in your daily life. Clearly, though, the intent is that the auto-collection process will capture most of the important stuff).</p>
<p>Next is &lsquo;Review,&rsquo; which will be familiar to those of you who know GTD. The basic idea is this: according to the GTD model, you should periodically review your open actions and projects to see if they are still correctly filed, within the correct context and project, etc. This is how you stay on track and keep all your actions in tidy order. This phase is fairly intuitive and similar to other GTD-based apps Ive looked at. Helpfully, the developer builds in pre-defined &lsquo;Reviews&rsquo; that you can select from a dropdown list while in the &lsquo;Organize&rsquo; phase. To initiate a review, you can either use an assigned shortcut key or choose a review option from the Menu Bar.</p>
<p>Next on the list is the &lsquo;Work&rsquo; category. This is the phase where you may view your actions organized by context. &lsquo;Context&rsquo; is GTD parlance for &lsquo;location.&rsquo; The &lsquo;@mac&rsquo; context, for example, lists items that must be done while you&rsquo;re at your Mac. GTD really emphasizes the context idea, and Midnight Inbox gets this. When you get down to doing stuff, the idea is that you&rsquo;ll base what you do on your location. At the Mac? Select the @Mac section, and get working. Note that Midnight Inbox (like OmniFocus and iGTD) also synchronizes your To Do list in iCal based on contexts with no option (that I could find) to do so by project.</p>
<p>After this phase, there is a &lsquo;Reference&rsquo; section to hold all the cats and dogs: actions that do not have a defined timeline, actions requiring an incubation period before you plan to begin working on them, ideas you wish to file for a later date, etc. I like how this section is organized — it clearly stands apart from the rest of the workflow and is easy to view at a glance. I like how this is handled in Inbox more than the methods employed by OmniFocus or iGTD.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And finally, there is an &lsquo;Archive&rsquo; category where all your completed projects are stored for posterity. (Actually, there&rsquo;s also a Trash bucket after the Archive section to hold stuff you delete - handy if you accidently delete an item and later decide to recover it). These items worked as advertised, so I have nothing really to add.</p>
<p>Oh, I forgot to mention the Yak Timer. Yes, the Yak Timer. This is a littler tickler the designer added to help you stay on track. It&rsquo;s a little reminder window that pops up at regular intervals (similar to an iCal reminder message) to help keep you focused and on track. I found it annoying. Fortunately, the Yak can be disabled from the Preferences menu. If you&rsquo;re easily distracted, you may find it handy.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I tried to use Midnight Inbox without referring to documentation, but I gave up after about thirty minutes of frustration. I usually start learning how to use a program by clicking around. This didn&rsquo;t get me far with Midnight Inbox. The biggest obstacle was a lack of intuitive control. The two prime examples of this: there are no right-click menus anywhere; and you can&rsquo;t toggle between items (such as choosing different contexts) by clicking on them — you must go up to the Menu Bar to do so.</p>
<p>In short, I headed for the app&rsquo;s Help files. While I found basic concepts and suggestions here, it wasn&rsquo;t really enough for me to get what I was supposed to do or how I was supposed to do it. I then shifted over to the developer&rsquo;s site and discovered a screencast tutorial. This helped a lot. I recommend you start there.</p>
<p>I have to say that I was not expecting the program to actively go out and gather stuff on my Mac. Once I got over that, and once I learned how to add my own projects and actions independently of this &lsquo;auto collecting&rsquo; feature, it started to click. Still, some aspects of the program remain mysterious to me even now. I think a few more screencasts from the developer would be a big help.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Not really, but as I said before, I think this program will appeal to many people. Namely, I think it will appeal to those who really love the GTD process and want a program that really sticks to the GTD workflow. Still, I have to say that the more I used it, the more I appreciated it. And just when I started to really adjust to Midnight Inbox, my trial period ended.</p>
<p>If you intend to use this program, I think you need to be prepared to commit to it in order to realize it&rsquo;s full potential. Certainly that&rsquo;s true of all of all of the GTD-based task management apps, but I felt like Midnight Inbox required an extra degree of commitment. I was unable to start adding projects and actions as easily as I did in, say, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iGTD<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniFocus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I first had to take a considerable amount of time to study how it worked. It&rsquo;s not without quirkiness — at times it felt more like I was learning how the developer&rsquo;s mind worked. In the end, I gained a real appreciation for the time and effort that must have gone into developing this tool. I also gained an appreciation for the logic behind the workflow. Yet, I concluded it was not for me. I would like to check out version 2.0 when it arrives to see how it has changed and improved.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>While the program integrates well with Mail &amp; iCal, and successfully reaches out to gather items from any folder on my Mac, the integration still seemed limited. It has the feel of a stand-alone application. Unlike OmniFocus or iGTD, there is no Services Menu function, there are no right-click menus, and there is no Apple Dock menu. You can&rsquo;t drag and drop items around (except from within the &lsquo;Organize&rsquo; window). Nor can you synch your data with other third-party Mac applications. I also could not find an export function to get my data out of Midnight Inbox and into a text file or other export format.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. How well could I manage all of my tasks (work, home, play, etc.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t use Mail, iCal, or the other pre-sets to manage your data, you can set up new rules to collect information from different areas or programs of your choosing. However, I found my choices to be limited. I use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yojimbo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for instance, to capture notes throughout the day, but I was unable to configure Inbox to automatically collect Yojimbo notes. Presumbaly, it&rsquo;s because Inbox doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with the SQL database where the Yojimbo notes are stored. That&rsquo;s a shame — I think more people might take the plunge and try the auto-collect idea if more types of data could be included.</p>
<p>It appears that the only real flexibility I have is to choose a file location of my choice where Inbox should collect stored text documents or files. Yet I can&rsquo;t really imagine getting any use out of collecting text files or documents. I simply don&rsquo;t store relevant information in stand-alone text documents or files (relevant to my task management process, that is). This limits the usefulness of the auto-collection process for me (particularly because I don&rsquo;t use iCal either).</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s an intriguing idea. I think there is a bright future for this kind of application: the meta-program that aggregates data and then allows you to process (file, tag, refine, categorize, etc.) a lot of information from many different sources on your Mac in one place. I look forward to seeing how the developer refines these ideas in future versions of Midnight Inbox.</p>
<p>Footnote: you can choose to turn off the auto-collection feature altogether from the Preferences menu if you would rather manually enter your own data.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->5. How did the program &lsquo;feel?&rsquo; How &lsquo;Mac-like&rsquo; is it?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>When I first launched Inbox, I was struck by the beauty of the user interface. The design is stunning. The look and feel of the program is undeniably like iTunes, but the metaphor breaks down there. Nothing about the program is much like iTunes when it comes to operational use. It&rsquo;s quite unique and, if my learning curve is any indication, will take the average user some time to really grasp.</p>
<p>For example, the top menu area of the program has an interface that looks like iTunes, but I never found clear documentation to show me what I was supposed to do with that giant &lsquo;Play/Pause&rsquo; button. I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s a timer with which you can countdown the minutes you&rsquo;ve alloted for a particular action. But why would I really want to do this? For such a large prominent button, it seems like it should be more important to the program. Likewise, the giant &lsquo;check&rsquo; button to the left of the &lsquo;iTunes&rsquo; window seems to only be for checking off an item when it&rsquo;s completed. However, it&rsquo;s much easier to just check the box next to the item to indicate it&rsquo;s completed. And then there&rsquo;s the big iTunes-like window at the top. It&rsquo;s clearly an information pane to indicate your current action, project, and context, but I didn&rsquo;t find it particulary useful. This window, for instance, provides a hint to &lsquo;Select a context from the Work menu to switch active actions,&rsquo; but I found it frustrating that I had to literally go to the work menu on the Menu Bar to change contexts. Clicking on the context doesn&rsquo;t do the job, nor does double-clicking. Again, I think building in more user-entry inroads would help.</p>
<p>Another curious interface choice is that you can&rsquo;t close the program window. The developer has disabled the &lsquo;Close&rsquo; button (I&rsquo;m talking about the red, yellow, and green buttons on the top left corner of every Mac window). You can minimize, you can toggle the size of the window, but you can&rsquo;t close the window. The only option is to &lsquo;Hide&rsquo; the program from the Menu Bar. I assume this is because you&rsquo;re not supposed to w
ant or need to close the main window once you open the program, and presumably the developer hopes that you will open the program first when you fire up your Mac. Me? I would like the choice.</p>
<p>Next, I found the use of the double-click in this program to be unintuitive. Double-clicking is how you pull up a menu to change the parameters of each item in Inbox. You can&rsquo;t right click on anything, which I intuitively wanted to do in order to get more options. I&rsquo;ve never used a program that required me to use the menu bar choices so often (sure, there are also a plethora of shortcut keys I could use to navigate through Inbox or to add or change options, but I normally don&rsquo;t get to learning &lsquo;power user&rsquo; shortcuts until I really know a program well).</p>
<p>So, Midnight Inbox has a way to go when it comes to that elusive &lsquo;Mac-like&rsquo; flow.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->In conclusion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: If you carry forth the intended integration of this app to it&rsquo;s full potential — that is, if you allow it to collect a good chunk of the daily data you accumulate on your Mac and then use the program to process all of this incoming data — it will surely be one of the most-used programs in your toolbox. But will you commit? It takes a lot of work. At times during my trial of this program, I felt like I was spending more time processing, organizing, and managing than actually getting things done.</p>
<p>Conceptually, Midnight Inbox is not really that distant from other Mac GTD-based task management apps. It&rsquo;s closest in function and design to iGTD, in my opinion. So why did I find this program harder to use than two GTD-based task management apps I&rsquo;ve tried out? I had a hard time quantifying this. It&rsquo;s strange. In one sense, the organizational structure of this program is very logical. It very closely follows the GTD process, perhaps more than any GTD task manager I&rsquo;ve reviewed. It&rsquo;s also aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>I think the issue for me lies in the way the data is managed. It&rsquo;s about the degree of flexibility. The only way I really got it working for me was to adopt the workflow planned out by the developer. I think that&rsquo;s what frustrated me. At times, I would begin to glimpse the potential of this app, only to be frustrated when I clicked on something to discover it didn&rsquo;t work the way I expected it to work. If the developer can open up the interface a bit so people can navigate around more freely, I think it would increase it&rsquo;s appeal. OmniFocus, for instance, is much more intuitive and freeform in the way it allows a user to add, sort, and categorize data. Midnight Inbox, conversely, is more about process: you need to be willing to follow a fairly rigid &lsquo;Getting Things Done&rsquo; workflow. I am personally more inclined to use a more flexible tool like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniFocus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or Cultured Code&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (which I&rsquo;ll review next).</p>
<p>A single license for Midnight Inbox is available for $35 (which is good through version 3.0). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Midnight Beep Softworks <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is now hard at work on version 2.0 of this application. Be sure to check it out.</p>
<p>Yet again, I want to note that &lsquo;GTD&rsquo; and &lsquo;Getting Things Done&rsquo; remain registered trademarks of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Allen &amp; Co<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>A friend emailed me last night to ask if I had tried &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cultured Code<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I have — this is one of the GTD-based task management applications I will review in the coming weeks. So far, I&rsquo;ve written about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iGTD<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniFocus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, both excellent applications. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->View from the Dock<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &lsquo;Getting Things Done&rsquo; task manager <!-- raw HTML omitted -->series<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is taking more time than I anticipated, mainly because it takes a while to understand and fully evaluate each application.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not really what I want to talk about. In this same email, I was also asked if I had tried Cultured Code&rsquo;s other product, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Xyle <!-- raw HTML omitted -->scope<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I thought I&rsquo;d post a few thoughts on this.</p>
<p>I tried out the full-featured trial of Xyle <!-- raw HTML omitted -->scope<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this past summer. I think it&rsquo;s is a really great application, especially if you&rsquo;re learning HTML and CSS. What is it? I think of it as an all-in-one tool to dissect a web page. It offers a quick, clean and tidy way to view underlying code, which is very handy if you&rsquo;re trying to figure out &lsquo;how&rsquo;d they do that?&rsquo; for a particular website that you like. It&rsquo;s also great if you&rsquo;re trying to match selectors with elements on a really complex page, or if you&rsquo;re trying to locate a bug.</p>
<p>I really like how Xyle <!-- raw HTML omitted -->scope<!-- raw HTML omitted --> displays HTML in a hierarchical view (a tree structure). It&rsquo;s much easier to grasp the structure of a page with this handy view. And if you click on any element on the page, you can readily see the code for just that element in the HTML pane. It&rsquo;s a very well-ordered, visual way to present code. The CSS views built into this tool are also very well designed, easy to navigate and powerful.</p>
<p>What strikes me most about Xyle <!-- raw HTML omitted -->scope<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is how attractively it&rsquo;s designed. I really like how it combines the &lsquo;what you see&rsquo; on a given web page with the &lsquo;what&rsquo;s behind what you see&rsquo; in the code. It&rsquo;s a real pleasure to use.</p>
<p>I almost bought this application but, in the end, I decided to stick with two free tools that perform most of the same feats as Xyle, even though I think they are much less elegant. I use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firefox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> when I&rsquo;m working on websites, and have grown to rely on Chris Pederick&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Web Developer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Joe Hewitt&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firebug<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Given that these two tools perform similar functions for free, I decided to stick with them. I also found that I preferred Firefox integration to opening up a separate stand-alone application when I want or need to quickly dissect a web page. It&rsquo;s just easier, and I&rsquo;m lazy.</p>
<p>What would convince me to reconsider? First, I should make it clear that I want Xyle <!-- raw HTML omitted -->scope<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in my toolbox for web development. I love it, I really do. Yet, I&rsquo;m held back. It&rsquo;s not really the price ($19.95). I think, rather, it&rsquo;s that Xyle <!-- raw HTML omitted -->scope<!-- raw HTML omitted --> stops short of what could be a great all-in-one application. In other words, I want to use it to edit XHTML and CSS, too.</p>
<p>I would like to be able to use Xyle as an analysis tool with tight browser integration: I want all of Xyle&rsquo;s power available within Firefox. Then, when I&rsquo;m ready to edit, I&rsquo;d like to flip a switch and start editing in a companion stand-alone application that integrates seamlessly with the analysis tools. Given the great design and sense of style of Xyle <!-- raw HTML omitted -->scope<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I would love to see what Cultured Code could do if they took it to the next level. I would consider buying that — and I&rsquo;d be willing to pay a higher price for it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This is the third post in a series comparing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->task management applications<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that are based to some degree on the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Things Done<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; process. Today I&rsquo;ll look at OmniGroup&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniFocus 1.0<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>OmniFocus is the latest offering from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniGroup<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, one of the most well-respected software developers for the Mac. As a long-time user of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniWeb<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (my casual browser of choice), I&rsquo;ve found OmniGroup to be quick to respond, helpful and friendly when contacted for support. This is a solid company, in other words, so I entered this evaluation full of optimism. I began using this app while it was still in Beta, and I&rsquo;m now using the free 14-day trial of version 1.0 (which launched on Jan. 7). I did not opt to buy the program while it was still in Beta (for a limited time, Beta users could buy it for ). The program now cost , which is perhaps the most notable thing to say about OmniFocus. It&rsquo;s expensive. Is it worth it? Before I get to that, let&rsquo;s take a look at the program.</p>
<p> </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Once you enter some actions, you assign them to projects and contexts (easy to choose from a dropdown list). Once you make all of your choices, you hit the &lsquo;Clean Up&rsquo; icon on the top menu bar, and your items magically file themselves away, disappearing from the inbox.</p>
<p>This is similar to the &lsquo;Process/Review&rsquo; function in iGTD, but I like the OmniFocus method because it&rsquo;s easier. In iGTD, processing and reviewing all happens from the same tool (&lsquo;Process/Review&rsquo;). With iGTD, you use keyboard shortcuts to fly through your tasks (iGTD calls them tasks, OmniFocus calls the actions) to re-sort or verify your contexts or projects, change a task&rsquo;s status, etc.</p>
<p>In OmniFocus, you assign each tasks as many or as few parameters you want, and then &lsquo;Clean Up.&rsquo; At it&rsquo;s most basic, you can just assign a project and/or a context. At it&rsquo;s most complex, you can assign each action a wide variety of parameters, which I&rsquo;ll cover when I talk about the Inspector (since that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll find these choices). Unlike iGTD, the &lsquo;reviewing&rsquo; part of OmniFocus is a distinct feature, separated from the initial &lsquo;processing&rsquo; of your actions. I&rsquo;ll cover this shortly as well.</p>
<p>This workflow — dump actions in, add some specific parameters or goalposts, then dispatch the actions off with &lsquo;Clean Up&rsquo; — is easy for me to grasp, and I like to see my Inbox empty when I clean up. It&rsquo;s a bit of nice user feedback that makes me feel, well, organized (or at least approaching organization).</p>
<p>In the screenshot [Note: screenshots removed], you&rsquo;ll also see some simple built-in color coding that appears once you assign due dates to your actions. The red text indicates an action that is past due; orange means it is due today. Easy enough. So far, this doesn&rsquo;t do anything that iGTD doesn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Where it differs is in design and workflow. It&rsquo;s obvious that the team who designed OmniFocus were striving for clean lines and simplicity while maintaining industrial-strength power under the hood. In effect, the powerful sorting/viewing guts of the app are carefully arranged and hidden until called upon by the user, whereas iGTD presents so many options and choices up-front, it feels as if you&rsquo;re looking at the guts.</p>
<p> </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the screenshot, you&rsquo;ll see a list of actions that are due that I can only do when I am using my Mac. Note that only items in each project that can be accomplished while using the Mac are shown in this view. This is handy. The way that OmniFocus handles contexts, and the sorting and viewing of contexts, works for me. It&rsquo;s intuitive and orderly.</p>
<p>One feature that sticks out is the ability to nest contexts within other contexts. For example, I have &lsquo;email&rsquo; and &lsquo;online&rsquo; as nested subcategories under &lsquo;Mac.&rsquo; While this sounded good to me in theory, in practice it was more organization than I needed. It was enough for me to simply identify &lsquo;Mac&rsquo; as a context. I don&rsquo;t need or want additional sub-categories. However, I readily admit that this will be very handy for users with more &lsquo;to do&rsquo; than me, namely business users (and those who like to be really, really organized).</p>
<p>Also note that some actions in the Context screenshot are purple. OmniFocus tries to be helpful by displaying certain colors for your actions. This can be useful, but it can also be confusing. Take the purple action: purple actions are the next items to do on your list. When you create a project, you can choose if the actions must be done one after the other (sequential) or in any order (parallel). A purple action means this is the next suggested action to do in your project (if order doesn&rsquo;t matter) or it means that this is the next action you must to before you proceed to the next action (if order does matter). Personally, I think the purple text should only be used where order is important. If order is unimportant to me, I don&rsquo;t need to have the first item on a parallel list to be highlighted. It&rsquo;s not necessary.</p>
<p>Final word on the Context screenshot: you&rsquo;ll note that I highlighted the &lsquo;View&rsquo; bar, which I&rsquo;ll discuss in brief next.</p>
<p> </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p> </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s so simple, I have nothing else to say about it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now we&rsquo;ll take a brief look at the OmniFocus review process (screenshot 5). The idea here is that you must periodically flip through all of your projects and actions to make sure they are still relevant, that they haven&rsquo;t changed, and that they are filed correctly (in terms of due dates, status, etc.). OmniFocus tries to make this painless by automatically setting up a review process based on the time that you entered the data. This view (the &lsquo;review view&rsquo;) can be, um, viewed by selecting the choice from the &lsquo;group projects by&rsquo; view drop-down list. What&rsquo;s important here is that the program tells you what you should review by week and within the month, and you are presented with a right-menu option to mark each project as reviewed (once you do this, that project will automatically be rescheduled for review in a few weeks). This is a pretty good way to handle the review process, which is one of the GTD process steps to ensure you are staying on track with your actions and projects. If you&rsquo;re like me, though, you may find this a little tedious. The &lsquo;Review View&rsquo; is yet another example of just how many different ways a user can rearrange actions and projects via the View Bar. It&rsquo;s truly amazing, truly powerful, and potentially truly confusing.</p>
<p> </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At any rate, the Inspector is one of those Mac-like ways to stick a ton of metadata in one place and get it away from your main application window, presumably because we Mac users like our main window to stay clean and lean. I like that the program is smart enough to interpret what I enter in the &lsquo;date&rsquo; and &lsquo;time&rsquo; fields of the Inspector: you can type any of the following: &lsquo;2d,&rsquo; &lsquo;3 mo,&rsquo; &lsquo;45m,&rsquo; &lsquo;next wed 1pm&rsquo; &hellip; and OmniFocus will interpret the date and time correctly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perspectives&rsquo; (the other info pane in screenshot 6) is, as far as I know, an idea unique to OmniFocus. Essentially, a Perspective is a way to capture a certain view for later. This little organizational tool is like a super-bookmark: it reminds me of a similar OmniWeb feature which allows one to take snapshots of all open pages and current views on those pages to save for later. I love this feature. It&rsquo;s a nice idea for OmniFocus — especially if, over time, you discover that you really like one particular view (or three or four) and would like to get back to that view quickly at a later time. Given the hundreds of viewing combinations one can choose from in this program, it&rsquo;s a good idea to give the user a way to store it. The one potential pitfall of this is that you must remember you are storing a snapshot of all your data in one particular viewing state. If you forget this, you might choose to view a Perspective and incorrectly think that some of your data is missing! It&rsquo;s not missing, of course, it&rsquo;s just that your &lsquo;Perspective&rsquo; only includes a subset of all of your data.</p>
<p> </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p> </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>No. I had to view the tutorial video and read the tutorial help files to really get going.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Yes and no. I have a lot of respect for OmniGroup. I am impressed that they brought in productivity gurus to try to get this application done right. I can see that they tried hard to make it simple enough for basic use but powerful enough for serious business use. I think it&rsquo;s a great start. I was still excited about the potential of this app a week later, but all of the sorting, viewing, and tagging options started to weigh on me. It&rsquo;s too much work! I began to feel that I was spending too much time planning and not enough time doing. To get the most out of this complex app, I think the secret would be to stick with it for a long time — you would have to commit to it, get to know it inside and out, develop routines and workflows that work for you. Then, I imagine the curve would change: it will begin to feel more like a a powerful tool that helps you get more done instead of a powerful tool with too many options.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Pretty good. Good integration for system-wide data entry (so you can easily enter new items, even when the program is hidden or closed). Not as many options for integration with other apps as iGTD (in fact, I think there is only iCal integration right now).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. How well could I manage all of my tasks (work, home, play, etc.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It did a good job of keeping track of the things I had to get done, but I found myself playing with the View options too often. I kept adding more metadata so I could use the various sort options to see how they worked. In other words, maybe there are too many options.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->5. How did the program &lsquo;feel?&rsquo; How &lsquo;Mac-like&rsquo; is it?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I think the user experience is good, but not great. The application is very Mac-like, in that I immediately knew how to move data around. I like the clever way that OmniGroup embedded the Views and Perspectives — when you step back and look at all the sorting and viewing tools they squeezed in there and then ponder how clean the user interface still looks, it&rsquo;s an impressive feat. The question is: are there simply too many viewing and tagging options? I felt bogged down in the end.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In conclusion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: this will likely be one of the top three GTD-based task managers. It&rsquo;s a solid program — and it&rsquo;s only at version 1.0. However, it costs too much for most Mac users. Those who are willing to plunk down for this will likely be serious business users who are serious about task management. The rest of us? I for one am still still seeking something a little easier to grasp, an even simpler user interface, perhaps a few less options, and a lower price point.</p>
<p>Once again, I want to point out that &lsquo;GTD&rsquo; and &lsquo;Getting Things Done&rsquo; are registered trademarks of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Allen &amp; Co<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I still don&rsquo;t want to get sued.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Omnigroup&rsquo;s OmniFocus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for several weeks now to prepare for my evaluation of this task management application (part of a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->series<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). It&rsquo;s quite an impressive tool. I&rsquo;m ready to put my thoughts together — look for it by the end of the weekend. Meanwhile, I want to comment on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPod Touch<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to retire my battle-worn third generation iPod this weekend. Now that the iPod Touch offers much of the same functionality as the iPhone, I&rsquo;m ready to ugrade. You might wonder why I&rsquo;m not going to spring for the iPhone. The main reason is cost — not the cost of the iPhone, but the cost of the AT&amp;T service plan. The cheapest plan equates to over $700 per year. Since I don&rsquo;t talk on the phone that much (and my current employer provides me with a cell phone), I&rsquo;ve decided the Touch is my best bet.</p>
<p>The only thing I think I&rsquo;ll miss is the iPhone&rsquo;s ability to surf the web and check email via the AT&amp;T EDGE network when one is not near a WiFi source. But I&rsquo;m confident that WiFi access points will continue to proliferate to a degree that will make it easier and easier to connect wherever I am. If I can&rsquo;t connect in some locations, no big deal. I don&rsquo;t really want to be connected in all places at all times anyway! When I&rsquo;m on a business trip, however, it will be a particularly nice feature to be able to browse the web, get directions, and check my mail from my hotel room or at a nearby coffee shop.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have mixed feelings about this. I can understand why some early adopters feel like they are getting ripped off and, in effect, penalized just for being early adopters. However, early adopters bought the Touch with full knowledge that it did not have all the software features of the iPhone. Apple never said that these features would eventually be added, although many hoped for this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that Apple opted to charge a nominal fee. The real question, I think, is if $20 is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;nominal&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;ve read that a fee of some sort is legally necessary because of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sarbannes-Oxley Act<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This Act apparently states that you can&rsquo;t add new features to something that you offer at a one-time fee without charging for the additional features. The iPhone is exempt from this because users pay running fees per month for this device. But what about the Apple TV? You don&rsquo;t need to pay a monthly fee for this appliance, right? Yet Apple rolled out a major software upgrade for this at Macworld as well&hellip;and they&rsquo;re offering it free to all, including existing Apple TV owners. Apple should better explain their rationale for the fee decisions they have made.</p>
<p>Still, I think it&rsquo;s not that bad of a thing. If you buy a new Mac, you get Leopard and the latest version of iLife pre-installed. But if you already owned an iMac when these updates shipped, you have to buy these upgrades. I don&rsquo;t see much of a difference between this and the situation with the iPod Touch. I suppose that&rsquo;s easy for me to say since I&rsquo;m going to get these additional apps for free.</p>
<p>So the question really comes down to this: why $20? Why not $5 (or whatever the minimum is to meet business/legal requirements). Twenty dollars seems a bit inflated. One thing is clear: this is a black eye for Apple. They have not offered a clear explanation to justify the upgrade cost for the iPod Touch, so people are drawing their own conclusions and forming unfavorable opinions. The impression Apple is leaving is that they may be getting a tad greedy&hellip;and they don&rsquo;t care much about early adopters (faithful consumers that Apple should want to take care of very well).</p>
<p>Perhaps all the bad press will lead Apple to offer a discount of some sort to those who must pay this fee, as they did for the early adopters who bought the first iPhones only to see the price of the phone drop a whopping two hundred dollars just a few weeks later. Or perhaps they will simply ignore the grumbling of a few iPod Touch owners and press on.</p>
<p>As Apple&rsquo;s market share continues to expand, I hope they don&rsquo;t lose sight of what makes them special. I&rsquo;d hate to see them become more like, er, that other company that sells PC operating systems.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dvorak<!-- raw HTML omitted --> users of the world scored a little victory this week. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TextExpander team at SmileOnMyMac<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fixed the problem with the Mac OS Dvorak-Qwerty keyboard layout, detailed in an earlier <!-- raw HTML omitted -->View from the Dock<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>A recap of this bug: when using the Mac OS Dvorak-Qwerty option, TextExpander did not previously work. Now it does. How did this come to pass? Me and at least <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one other user<!-- raw HTML omitted --> asked that it be fixed. And it was fixed, very promptly. I&rsquo;d like to thank <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SmileOnMyMac<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for listening. I am a very satisfied customer. And here&rsquo;s more unsolicited praise for TextExpander — it saves me an amazing amount of time (I just used it to add the previous Em dash). My wife is a devoted user, too. She uses TextExpander to save keystrokes on her <!-- raw HTML omitted -->website<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Now I am going to try to get Adobe to fix their Creative Suite. Unfortunately, I must still switch to the QWERTY keyboard layout when I&rsquo;m using PhotoShop and the other Adobe apps, and I shouldn&rsquo;t have to do this. Maybe it will be fixed if <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple buys Adobe<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!</p>
<p>If you do your typing on a Mac and you use Dvorak, I want to ensure you know that you can quickly toggle between Qwerty and Dvorak (or Dvorak-Qwerty, or other languages). Once you enable these option in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->International Preference Pane<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (found under Apple&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->System Preferences<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), you can choose to show this input menu in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Menu Bar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You may then quickly toggle between the different keyboard layouts using a keyboard shortcut of your choice (I use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->option-command-space<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>A quick reminder: if you use Windows, check out SkyEnergy&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HotKeyz<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This little freeware program allows you to easily remap shortcut keys (paste, save, copy, etc.) to match the QWERTY key positions while using the Dvorak layout. It works quite well.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to point out a new development that is full of potential for those of us who use alternative typing layouts. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I&rsquo;d like to look down at my keyboard and actually see the Dvorak layout. I may be able to do just that in the not-to-distant future. Check out this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ArsTechnica report<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about a recent Apple patent for a dynamically controlled keyboard.</p>
<p>Imagine a keyboard with organic LEDs on each key. If you&rsquo;re curious about the possibilities, see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Art Lebedev&rsquo;s Optimus Maximus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (it&rsquo;s available now, if you can afford it). I imagine a future Apple keyboard that displays the Dvorak keys, then dynamically displays QWERTY keys when I press a command-key combination. And I envision my keyboard dynamically changing to display game-specific commands or key combinations for shortcut-intensive programs like Photoshop or Final Cut Studio. This is surely the keyboard of the future, and I can&rsquo;t wait to get one.</p>

			 <p>I discovered the solution to the WordPress registration problem. You will now receive an email with your chosen user name and password when you subscribe to this site.

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I recently completed a project that began with installing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VMware Fusion<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my Intel iMac and (unexpectedly) ended with an old Compaq Presario laptop running <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Linux<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you&rsquo;re an adventurous type and wish to reclaim an old PC, or if you just switched to a mac and now have an old PC collecting dust, read on. In my case, a friend donated an old Compaq laptop to me (she switched to an iMac) so I could use it to test out websites on Internet Explorer. It did the job &hellip; but just barely. Windows XP just doesn&rsquo;t run well on 58MB of RAM! My workflow went like this: launch Explorer, go for a snack, take a bathroom break, play with the cat, then arrive back at the laptop to either (a) load the page I wished to preview or (b) discover the machine had inexplicably froze.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thankfully, my intel-based iMac is now handily running Windows XP and the old laptop is now obsolete. Or so I thought. On a whim, I installed Ubuntu Linux on my iMac (again, using virtual machine wizadry) just to test it out. I was amazed - it was fast, enjoyable, and very useable. One nice thing about Linux is that the OS shares the same Unix underpinnings as Mac OSX, so if you&rsquo;ve been using X for a while, you&rsquo;ll feel fairly comfortable in the new environment. When I started learning more about Linux, I was surprised at the dozens of &lsquo;flavors&rsquo; of this OS and the vaster number of open source (free) software applications that run on it (all of which can run on Mac OS too, by the way). I am in awe that there are so many people out there developing this stuff out of sheer passion and dedication. How cool is that?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It was then that inspiration struck. Why not install Linux on my old Compaq paperweight? What a great way to use an old machine, and to learn more about Linux (and Unix) - skills that will make me a better Mac user too. I was not dissapointed. Linux turned my Compaq into a very usable machine that is suprisingly responsive (I won&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s speedy - but it runs like lightning compared to running Windows). For the first time in my life, I actually enjoyed using a Compaq (despair over a Compaq drove me to switch to a mac in 2000!). I now have a risk-free platform on which I can learn about Linux and develop my Unix skills. It also serves, simply, as an extra PC around the house. True, I can also learn Unix commands via the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Terminal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my mac (on Mac OSX or using a virtual machine to run Linux), but it gives me greater peace of mind to explore the inner workings of Unix on a totally separate machine. I can try things I would be hesitant to try on the mac. And if I really mess something up on my Compaq (and I already have), I don&rsquo;t really care. I just reinstall the operating system and try again.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Linux version I&rsquo;m using — <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Puppy Linux<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — is under 100MB, so it&rsquo;s quick to reload. A warning to you, though: it took me (a Unix novice with no prior Linux experience) several days of experimentation to get everything up and running on the laptop. Now that I have the process down, I can reformat the partition of the hard drive and reinstall a clean version of Linux in about 15 minutes. But you should know that you may have to get under the hood and expirement to get it working (here, I&rsquo;m mainly talking about the drivers for your USB plug-ins, network connection, or printer) &hellip; but that&rsquo;s what makes it so much fun. It&rsquo;s a good way to learn.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To be fair, I think my experience had a lot to do with the Compaq and my inexperience and little to do with the Linux packages I tried (searching user forums, I discovered that many people aptly refer to these old Compaq laptops as &lsquo;craptops&rsquo;). If you are installing Linux on a newer laptop (newer than my Presario 1200 running at 500Mhz with 58MB RAM) or perhaps on a laptop of higher quality, you may have no trouble at all. I had plenty of trouble. And that leads us to the first rule to follow before you start any project like this: backup any data on the target machine that you wish to keep! I&rsquo;ll post about how I choose a Linux version to install and the steps I took to get it running very soon. I want to end on this note: you will not get a laptop out of this that can run all your mac or pc applications. You&rsquo;ll be using freeware versions of applications that do much of the same thing. So what&rsquo;s it good for? You get a machine for light text work, email, and web browsing on a machine that was formerly unbearable to use. You get to experience an operating system that is increasingly used around the world because it&rsquo;s free and it works well. And you get a platform on which you can learn Unix. Not bad for a PC I formerly considered trash.</p>

I encountered yet another Dvorak bug today. For the benefit of those (ok, probably all of you) who do not know what Dvorak is, it&rsquo;s an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->alternative keyboard layout<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s generally considered faster and more efficient than the standard QWERTY layout.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can certainly type quite fast and, since the Dvorak keys are not in the same place as the QWERTY keys, I learned to type without ever looking down &hellip; it wouldn&rsquo;t help anyways. Never needing to look down is a plus in my book. Anyhow, it turns out that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TextExpander<!-- raw HTML omitted --> does not support the Dvorak-Qwerty keyboard layout. Dvorak-Qwerty is a Mac OS option (available via the International/Input Menu preference pane) that allows one to type in Dvorak but still access the command shortcut keys in their designated QWERTY positions. That means that I can type in Dvorak, but still use the QWERTY Command-C/V/Q etc. The tech support guy (who responded to my query very quickly, I should add) said that the add this support to the feature request list, although he was not authorized to say if it would or would not be fixed to add this support.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So what&rsquo;s the bug? When the keyboard setting is DQ (that&rsquo;s short for Dvorak-Qwerty), TextExpander cannot expand text. You type in the short cut, and your shortcut is replaced by &hellip; nothing. You just get an empty string where your expanded text should go. This is frustrating. Sometimes I feel like I&rsquo;m the only Dvorak user out there, though I&rsquo;m sure I am not. A great feature of the Mac OS is the built in Dvorak support with QWERTY command keys. While Windows supports Dvorak as an option, it does not (and apparently will never) support the QWERTY command function.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Even though I use this alternate layout, I am a slave to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac keyboard shortcuts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (the QWERTY style shortcuts). The Mac OS has long supported this, recognizing the need amongst mac users to have command-C map to the &lsquo;C&rsquo; character printed on the physical keyboard, even though it&rsquo;s not the &lsquo;C&rsquo; character in the Dvorak layout is located where the I character is printed. Make sense? Windows does not have this. I was using a freeware program called Hotkeyz on my Windows (work) machine to remap my keys. This solved the PC problem beautifully. But, alas, my IT staff made me take it off because of my workplace &lsquo;no shareware or freeware policy.&rsquo; Blah.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyhow, most mac programs work fairly well with Dvorak-Qwerty. Except for TextExpander, and except for Adobe CS3 (actually, I don&rsquo;t believe Adobe products have ever supported Dvorak-Qwerty &hellip; and except for Mac MS Office (which I don&rsquo;t use - iWork handles Dvorak quite well). What this means for me is that I have to turn Qwerty on when using Photoshop, because Command-C otherwise does not work. I could re-learn the shortcuts for the remapped Dvorak keys, but I don&rsquo;t want to. I like the shortcut keys mapped to what&rsquo;s printed on the keyboard. Besides, I&rsquo;m so conditioned to type the Command key shortcuts that it would take major reconditioning to learn the alternate locations. The bottom line for me is this: I know there aren&rsquo;t many of us out there, but there are people out there that rely on Dvorak-Qwerty. The combo, exclusive to the mac, is one of those little things that makes my mac experience better than my work-a-day PC experience. I can&rsquo;t imagine it would take much of a code fix to support this feature &hellip; it is built in to the OS, after all. So, Adobe and Smile on My Mac &hellip;  please support the DQ keyboard layout!!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way, I found this nice little <!-- raw HTML omitted -->freeware app<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that fixes one annoying DQ layout problem - the inability to use command+shift in DQ</p>

			 <p>With the advent of Mac OS 10.5 Leopard, backup is now easier than it&rsquo;s ever been. Using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Time Machine<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a simple process: you&rsquo;re asked if you want to use it on an external disk as soon as the disk mounts. You choose &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; Then, you choose which folders to exclude from the backup (which is not very intuitive — you have to add folders to subtract them from the back up). At any rate, that&rsquo;s about it. You&rsquo;re done. The only thing you have to remember to do, if you&rsquo;re using an external drive, is to turn it on (that&rsquo;s if you don&rsquo;t leave your computer and external drives on when not in use to save power). That&rsquo;s nice. That&rsquo;s easy.  Time Machine, as you likely know, allows you to go back in time to recover lost files. This is a welcome addition to my backup scheme. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But it&rsquo;s not the end-all of backup for two reasons:  it&rsquo;s not a bootable clone and the backup is stored on a local drive either inside or next to your primary mac. The bootable part is important if you want to be able to keep on working if your primary drive dies. Having your most critical data stored somewhere other than home is important because fires, floods, and terrible things can happen. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here are a few additional steps (in addition to using Time Machine)  I take to keep me covered for almost any scenario. First, I ensure I always have a bootable clone. I use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SuperDuper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the popular little backup app that allows you to make an exact mirror copy of your primary drive. Because SuperDuper makes your backup bootable, and because it&rsquo;s an exact replica of your drive, you can keep on working if your main drive dies. (note that SuperDuper is not yet Leopard-ready as of the time of this post)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you have more than one mac in your home, the bootable backup is even handier. Say that you have to send your iMac in to get repaired after a hard drive failure. It&rsquo;s gone for two weeks. But, during this time, you need to keep working with the applications and files that were on that computer. No problem. All you need to do is plug in your external drive to one of your other macs and boot up from that drive (Preferences: Startup Disk). It&rsquo;s not going to be as fast as using your primary mac, and the cloned copy might be a few days old &hellip; but, trust me, it beats the alternative. Alternatively, if you&rsquo;re in the middle of some critical work that you must finish and you don&rsquo;t have a second mac, a bootable clone allows you to keep on working on that machine. When you&rsquo;re done, then you can send in your imac for repair. Of course, if you have a macpro, then you probably have more than one internal drive and you can fix your dead drive all by yourself. The key to backup, of course, is frequency and consistency. You need to do it often and on a set schedule. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That&rsquo;s why I paid for SuperDuper instead of using the free built-in Disk Utility or the free <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Carbon Copy Cloner<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It has a &lsquo;Smart Update&rsquo; feature. Those other two do the job well, but the don&rsquo;t have this feature. This means that SuperDuper only replaces what is needed to make your backup identical to your source disk. you&rsquo;ll appreciate this feature immediately if you have a lot of data. For me, it means each backup takes about 15 minutes for 120GB of data. A full Not-Smart update, by contrast, can easily take an hour or more. As an aside, SuperDuper is popular for other reasons as well: it is beautifully and thoughtfully designed, it does one thing and does it extremely well, and the application&rsquo;s instructions and explanations are very easy to understand. And do you know why it&rsquo;s called &lsquo;SuperDuper?&rsquo; It only occurred to me yesterday that the Duper is short for Duplicate. That may have been obvious to others, but it only just occurred to me. Now let&rsquo;s just hope the SuperDuper team get the Leopard-ready version of their software working very soon.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, now you have Time Machine and SuperDuper. Should you put them both on the same drive? Not if you can help it — you can easily do this with disk partitions, but if that one disk goes, you&rsquo;re going to lose the whole disk &hellip; not just one partition. Having said that, I did place my SuperDuper and Time Machine backups on the same drive. My reasoning? I never worried about having only one disk when I only used SuperDuper &hellip; so I&rsquo;ll take my chances and place them on the same disk. The odds of that disk and the internal drive of my iMac both dying simultaneously are, I like to think, pretty remote. I am using a 500GB <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lacie d2 Quadra<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with two partitions. For SuperDuper, I alloted 200GB. My iMac drive is 230GB. I figure if I get up to 200GB of data on this disk, it&rsquo;ll either be time to think about archiving some stuff or deleting some apps/files &hellip; or it&rsquo;ll be about time for a new mac.  So 200GB is big enough. I used the rest of the disk space for my Time Machine partition. Instead of using Time Machine to back up the entirety of my iMac internal drive, I only set it to back up the user folders.  This setting should give me a lot of space to go pretty far back in time for my files only. For the apps, if I have to restore them, I&rsquo;ll use my SuperDuper clone.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But what happens if you have a fire, flood, theft, etc. and you lose your external drive backups and your mac? You&rsquo;re screwed. Unless, that is, you employ some sort of off-site backup scheme. While there are now a slew of online companies which offer external backup locations for your stuff (for a modest monthly fee), you may ask yourself if this is secure. (There is a good wrap-up of current services in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->December 2007 issue of MacWorld<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by the way). It very well may be secure and I&rsquo;m sure this is a viable option, but I haven&rsquo;t ventured to try this yet. My current solution is a bit convoluted, but I think it keeps my data pretty well distributed. My main off-site strategy is this: I bought a tiny little <!-- raw HTML omitted -->160GB Iomega external drive<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Not only is it quite small, but it purportedly has some patented bump-and-drop protection built in, which can&rsquo;t hurt. I back up all documents and photos from all my macs onto this drive using the free <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SilverKeeper<!-- raw HTML omitted --> backup software — just the things I absolutely, positively would be devastated to lose in a worse-case scenario. I then take this disk off-site and store it securely at work. You might also consider storing it in a fireproof/waterproof safe at home, but I&rsquo;m not crazy about that idea. In the case of a fire, this safe could get quite hot. While the papers inside may not mind, I think a hard drive would. You might also consider storing it with a trusted friend or family. Note that I don&rsquo;t back up my iTunes library to it — it&rsquo;s huge &hellip; and it&rsquo;s already backed up to my iPod (always with me) and my Time Machine and SuperDuper clone. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, I employ a few odds-and-ends backups. I use a simple automator script to &lsquo;sync&rsquo; calendar, address book and mail to an external server where I host my websites. This <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lifehacker.com post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will show you the basic idea. If you subscribe to .Mac or use a different synching application, this wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary. But this is a cheaper way to go and it gets the job done. I also selectively backup some files to my gmail account (you could also use an external server for this) just for convenience - my wife&rsquo;s Rapidweaver backup, for instance, and some writing projects that I may want quick access to on the go. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, putting it all together, this scheme isn&rsquo;t too complicated. Time Machine
is automatic. SuperDuper clones are automatically scheduled for every other day (or will be, once the shareware is Leopard certified). Automator synching is manually done once a week (I just need to click a button to sync — <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chronosync<!-- raw HTML omitted --> might also be an easier way to do this. I&rsquo;ve heard great things about it, but I don&rsquo;t have any experience using it). Once a month, I update my off-site Iomega disk. This certainly isn&rsquo;t the easiest methodology, and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not the best methodology, but hopefully it will give you some points to consider to develop your own backup scheme.</p>

So, I talked my wife into accompanying me to the Ala Moana mall in Honolulu yesterday for the Leopard launch. No, I didn&rsquo;t actually buy Leopard (see last post - plus, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amazon.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has it for a cheaper price with no tax). I did, however, get a nice Leopard T-shirt (as did my wife), and I picked up a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LaCie d2 Quadra 500GB<!-- raw HTML omitted --> external drive and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iLife'08<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. We only waited for about an hour and a half. Was that worth a free Leopard T-shirt? Yeah, sure. Of course, there are already people selling their shirts on Craigslist and Ebay. Last I checked, they were going for between $30 and $50 &hellip; but I&rsquo;m keeping mine.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And here are a few photos from the opening. It was a lot of fun. There were probably about 200 people in line at the opening bell at 6pm (although I couldn&rsquo;t actually see the end of the line, so it may have been more) and enough security to manage a sizable rock concert. It was a bit disconcerting as we entered the store. We were about 20 or 30 deep in the line, so as we were part of the first group to enter, we were greeted by a sea of Apple employees clapping and ecstatically cheering for us. Very energetic. Disconcerting. I couldn&rsquo;t believe how many Apple employees they squeezed into this little store.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was impressed, though, by the organization of the event. As I walked in, I was asked if I was there to buy Leopard. I said no, but I wanted a hard drive &hellip; and my escort pointed to the back of the store and said, &lsquo;John will take care of you.&rsquo; Sure enough, there was John at the back of the store, grinning and waving at me to come on down. Now <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> customer service. Three Apple people tried to grab me on the way out to explain how Leopard worked, but I declined. I&rsquo;ll come back when there&rsquo;s more room to hang out.</p>
