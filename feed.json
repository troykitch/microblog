The first one in the image below is for cutting the angles needed. I made this design up and I’m proud of it because it is all self-contained and can hang on a wall. You’ll see how it’s used shortly.

The two short pieces of hard maple can be flipped around so each has two angles available. These fit into the jig with an adjustable stop for longer pieces.

I can just cut new maple blocks if I need other angles to make other Kumiko patterns.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2022/78453d6175.jpg\" alt=\"K8\" title=\"k8.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" /></p>\n\n<p>And here is my first Kumiko pattern (in the classic asa-no-ha shape).

				"title": "Herb Drying Rack",
				"content_html": "<p>Here&rsquo;s a project using scrap walnut tongue-and-groove boards I was given by friend, which I used to create a small tray to dry herbs — my wife does a lot with herbal tinctures and such and needed a rack to dry some of the plants and mushrooms she collects while foraging.</p>\n\n<p>This is the final drying rack:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2022/7e1c894452.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray final\" title=\"serving-tray-final.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></p>\n\n<p>The biggest challenge in creating this was the small size. Here is the walnut board I started with:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2022/f161337bac.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray1\" title=\"serving-tray1.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2667\" /></p>\n\n<p>I used a holding tool I previously made called a <a href=\"https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/c5a299ed-e09c-44b6-9b5c-b5ebc12549fc/RAAMTANG-VISE?hl=en\">Raamtang</a> to keep all the small bits held firmly while I worked on them. This small wooden vise has proven invaluable over the years and is worth the time and effort to build if you create a lot of smaller projects.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2022/8970e2d705.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray raamtang\" title=\"serving-tray_raamtang.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></p>\n\n<p>I decided to make this a simple mitered box, but will add splines for strength. I cut the angles free hand and then dialed them in with this 45 degree shooting board I made. The final pieces are shown here resting on top of the shooting board.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2022/77613ba2bb.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray mitered edges\" title=\"serving-tray_mitered-edges.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2667\" /></p>\n\n<p>I added a fancy curve to the four edges of the tray. I drew the curve on paper then traced it onto the wood. I used a backsaw to cut the to lines of the curve.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2022/29011a065e.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray shape1\" title=\"serving-tray_shape1.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></p>\n\n<p>Then used a coping saw to get near my lines.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2022/ec785a7dd7.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray shape2\" title=\"serving-tray_shape2.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n\n<p>Then cleaned it all up with files and a spokeshave.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2022/99525de9df.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray shaping edges\" title=\"serving-tray_shaping-edges.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></p>\n\n<p>Here are the final curved edges.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2022/a5b825f031.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray pieces\" title=\"serving-tray_pieces.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></p>\n\n<p>After glueing up the frame, I added the splines with a contrasting wood (scraps of oak). I cut out the corners, cut the splines, then planed them flush with a block plane.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2022/933c050d90.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray spline start\" title=\"serving-tray_spline-start.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2022/cfdb33fbb6.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray spline\" title=\"serving-tray-spline.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2022/bc07fffe17.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray spline final\" title=\"serving-tray_spline-final.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></p>\n\n<p>Then the final step was adding the chicken wire, for which I used some mesh from a big box store.

				"content_text": "Here's a project using scrap walnut tongue-and-groove boards I was given by friend, which I used to create a small tray to dry herbs — my wife does a lot with herbal tinctures and such and needed a rack to dry some of the plants and mushrooms she collects while foraging.\n\nThis is the final drying rack:\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/7e1c894452.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray final\" title=\"serving-tray-final.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" />\n\nThe biggest challenge in creating this was the small size. Here is the walnut board I started with:\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/f161337bac.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray1\" title=\"serving-tray1.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2667\" />\n\nI used a holding tool I previously made called a <a href=\"https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/c5a299ed-e09c-44b6-9b5c-b5ebc12549fc/RAAMTANG-VISE?hl=en\">Raamtang</a> to keep all the small bits held firmly while I worked on them. This small wooden vise has proven invaluable over the years and is worth the time and effort to build if you create a lot of smaller projects.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/8970e2d705.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray raamtang\" title=\"serving-tray_raamtang.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" />\n\nI decided to make this a simple mitered box, but will add splines for strength. I cut the angles free hand and then dialed them in with this 45 degree shooting board I made. The final pieces are shown here resting on top of the shooting board.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/77613ba2bb.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray mitered edges\" title=\"serving-tray_mitered-edges.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2667\" />\n\nI added a fancy curve to the four edges of the tray. I drew the curve on paper then traced it onto the wood. I used a backsaw to cut the to lines of the curve.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/29011a065e.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray shape1\" title=\"serving-tray_shape1.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" />\n\nThen used a coping saw to get near my lines. \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/ec785a7dd7.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray shape2\" title=\"serving-tray_shape2.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n\nThen cleaned it all up with files and a spokeshave.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/99525de9df.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray shaping edges\" title=\"serving-tray_shaping-edges.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" />\n\nHere are the final curved edges.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/a5b825f031.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray pieces\" title=\"serving-tray_pieces.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" />\n\nAfter glueing up the frame, I added the splines with a contrasting wood (scraps of oak). I cut out the corners, cut the splines, then planed them flush with a block plane.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/933c050d90.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray spline start\" title=\"serving-tray_spline-start.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" />\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/cfdb33fbb6.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray spline\" title=\"serving-tray-spline.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" />\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/bc07fffe17.jpg\" alt=\"Serving tray spline final\" title=\"serving-tray_spline-final.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" />\n\nThen the final step was adding the chicken wire, for which I used some mesh from a big box store. The wire mesh is attached to the underside of the frame with wood strips half-lapped, glued and strengthened with small screws. That's it.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/a527c9fa1d.jpg\" alt=\"Final frame\" title=\"final-frame.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" />\n",

Since I just needed a little bit, I used the epoxy that I use for fly tying. I did this so that the knots don't crumble over time.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.troykitch.com/uploads/2021/b4577a9600.jpg\" alt=\"Bench final 3\" title=\"bench-final-3.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" />\n\nHere’s the dry fit of the frame.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.troykitch.com/uploads/2021/707c537f51.jpg\" alt=\"Bench final 4\" title=\"bench-final-4.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\nAnd here’s some shots of the final bench after glue-up and finishing:\n\n<img src=\"https://www.troykitch.com/uploads/2021/61f8ffc0c1.jpg\" alt=\"Bench final 5\" title=\"bench-final-5.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://www.troykitch.com/uploads/2021/c36787ea1f.jpg\" alt=\"Bench final 6\" title=\"bench-final-6.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://www.troykitch.com/uploads/2021/6496b61207.jpg\" alt=\"Bench final 7\" title=\"bench-final-7.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://www.troykitch.com/uploads/2021/37954c5c7f.jpg\" alt=\"Bench final 8\" title=\"bench-final-8.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://www.troykitch.com/uploads/2021/3e0ffdbe4b.jpg\" alt=\"Bench final 9\" title=\"bench-final-9.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://www.troykitch.com/uploads/2021/5248a2d5eb.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 0626\" title=\"IMG_0626.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\n\nAnd here's what I started with for reference: some old, incredbily warped slabs of walnut ... and a new sapele board for the aprons. This transformation of chunks of wood to useable furniture is just magical to me. With some simple tool work and a plan, amorphous slabs can transform into something useful and beautiful. \n\n<img src=\"https://www.troykitch.com/uploads/2021/47af382614.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 0430\" title=\"IMG_0430.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://www.troykitch.com/uploads/2021/eb56023094.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 0568\" title=\"IMG_0568.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n",

I decided to go for a big wide curve. To create that curve, I attached a string and pencil to my shop bents, then moved it to the right distance to get the desired arc.

I marked out proportions that looked nice to me by marking up three 10mm sections with two 5mm steps, and then using the base of a marking gauge to draw some circles until I liked the look of it. While I typically use English units, I often switch to metric for mark up for things like this because for me it’s just easier.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.troykitch.com/uploads/2021/bc18177ee5.jpg\" alt=\"Bench img 0587\" title=\"bench-img_0587.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" /></p>\n\n<p>I started out using my bow saw, but I soon decided to saw to the line in segments across the curve just to help get rid of waste as I cut with the bow saw; cutting out little sections makes it easier for me, at least psychologically.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.troykitch.com/uploads/2021/3b8459c101.jpg\" alt=\"Bench img 0588\" title=\"bench-img_0588.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" /></p>\n\n<p>Here’s what that looked like about halfway through:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.troykitch.com/uploads/2021/60c19d8024.jpg\" alt=\"Bench img 0589\" title=\"bench-img_0589.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" /></p>\n\n<p>After it was roughed out, I started getting closer to the line with a spokeshave.

Next, I need to do this for the back apron so it matches. I think I’ll just leave the short side sapele aprons as they are (squared off), but I want the front and back to match, even though the back of the bench will be against a wall (it’s going to be a bench for the mudroom to put on shoes).

But each wrist rest and each keyboard half are free floating so they are always moving around. This is especially annoying when I need to move this stuff out of the way to clean underneath, or to use my <a href=\"https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=3917\">secondary mechanical keyboard</a>. Another problem: the trackpad in the center is too low, weirdly placed, and is just not great.

But it was worth the effort. Now when I need to move my rather elaborate keyboard set up out of the way to clean underneath, or when I want more desk space for a non-computer task, or to switch keyboards, I can quickly set things back up with the exact spacing and angling I want. I start by placing the wrist rests:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.troykitch.com/uploads/2021/07f54e3313.jpg\" alt=\"478afbdc0f\" title=\"478afbdc0f.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>And then place each keyboard half against the wrist rests:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.troykitch.com/uploads/2021/c637931068.jpg\" alt=\"2b61e56ca5\" title=\"2b61e56ca5.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>And then place the trackpad on the raised, angled stand in the middle. The cable that connects the two keyboard parts tucks neatly under the trackpad. I wanted to keep this as minimalist as possible, so I made it so that the trackpad front edge rests on the stand, but it's angled so that the trackpad back edge rests perfectly on the keyboard edges. This is the minimal width to fit the trackpad and the spacing is just right (for me) for typing. It is very stable and feels solid.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.troykitch.com/uploads/2021/8faaac99f5.jpg\" alt=\"6ac1991e44\" title=\"6ac1991e44.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>So I'm going to use this for a few days and make sure I like it, then I'll finalize everything, glue it up, give it a coat of Osmo.

This was, for me, an intimidating project to build these tools using only hand tools. The plans I used are from <a href=\"https://www.highlandwoodworking.com/the-unplugged-workshop.aspx\">Tom Fidgen's The Unplugged Workshop</a>. The plane, in particular. Here's how that went.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/f1da572154.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1454 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1454-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>I started with a small slab of Koa. It&rsquo;s a special plane, so I decided to use some of the special wood I had bought when I had lived in Hawaii. I printed out the plan for the plane body at actual size and traced it out. I placed the plane blade here so I could better visualize what I was doing.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what it looks like all penciled out.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/c441b7156c.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1455 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1455-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>I cut out part of the body with a Carcase saw and my bow saw. Then came the scary part: carefully drilling out the holes for the special screws (forget the name of these) that would hold the blade in place.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/353ff43119.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1472 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1472-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n\n<p>You have to drill two holes on each side so that these screws sit flush. Not easy to do with with a hand drill, I discovered.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/42bcd5c30f.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1471 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1471-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a View of cutting the inside handle hold with my bow saw.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/4b232a52b2.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1475 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1475-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>And then some heavy and tedious filing to get everything down to the lines and smoothed out.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/5429419a67.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1476 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1476-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>The threads in the plane body and the threads for the bolts are created with a thread cutter.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/847aee9a25.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1446 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1446-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>And here is how the screws are made for the arms. I used walnut because it&rsquo;s pretty easy to work with, relatively speaking.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/acb67ac102.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1448 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1448-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>Rough cut for each wooden bolt. Then file them out to round them.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/7ed2a2a555.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1448 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1448-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>The completed arms with the bolts. These fit into the plane body like so, using the threads I created.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/32be9f97d0.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1478 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1478-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>The most terrifying part of the plane build was cutting the kerf to fit the blade. It had to be perfect, so I created a jig to guide my saw and went really, really slow.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/1fc8d0bb5f.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1456 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1456-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>So I created this fence for the plane and glued it up, then realized I had made a terrible mistake. It&rsquo;s way too thick. It needs to rest against the blade, but this fence hits the plane body and was a total fail. Not sure how I got to this point, but there it is. So what to do?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/be796cabc6.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1490 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1490-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>I could have started all over with the plane fence, but I decided to salvage it. So that&rsquo;s why you see these interesting light colored things that look like joints that don&rsquo;t joint anything. I installed a proper smaller fence arm. I tried to make the mistake look like a feature and not a bug. Here, you can see the blade is installed.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/4e4959d4cf.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1505 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1505-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>A view of the final plane from the another angle.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/df25594b2f.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1506 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1506-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>Here it is in action, cutting the kerf on a board that I&rsquo;m going to resew with the frame saw. The wooden bolts lock the fence in place to get the desired line.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/7f8f3995a9.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1510 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1510-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>And that kerf gives you a good line all around the board to help keep the frame saw cutting true.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/107bd3e081.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1512 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1512-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n\n<p>The result is resawed boards that are far better than I&rsquo;d get than without using the Kerfing Plane.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2021/c06745364d.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1513 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1513-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n",

Not easy to do with with a hand drill, I discovered.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/42bcd5c30f.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1471 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1471-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nHere's a View of cutting the inside handle hold with my bow saw.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/4b232a52b2.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1475 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1475-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nAnd then some heavy and tedious filing to get everything down to the lines and smoothed out.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/5429419a67.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1476 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1476-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nThe threads in the plane body and the threads for the bolts are created with a thread cutter.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/847aee9a25.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1446 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1446-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nAnd here is how the screws are made for the arms. I used walnut because it's pretty easy to work with, relatively speaking.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/acb67ac102.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1448 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1448-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nRough cut for each wooden bolt. Then file them out to round them. \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/7ed2a2a555.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1448 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1448-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nThe completed arms with the bolts. These fit into the plane body like so, using the threads I created.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/32be9f97d0.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1478 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1478-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nThe most terrifying part of the plane build was cutting the kerf to fit the blade. It had to be perfect, so I created a jig to guide my saw and went really, really slow.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/1fc8d0bb5f.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1456 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1456-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nSo I created this fence for the plane and glued it up, then realized I had made a terrible mistake. It's way too thick. It needs to rest against the blade, but this fence hits the plane body and was a total fail. Not sure how I got to this point, but there it is. So what to do?\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/be796cabc6.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1490 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1490-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nI could have started all over with the plane fence, but I decided to salvage it. So that's why you see these interesting light colored things that look like joints that don't joint anything. I installed a proper smaller fence arm. I tried to make the mistake look like a feature and not a bug. Here, you can see the blade is installed.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/4e4959d4cf.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1505 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1505-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nA view of the final plane from the another angle.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/df25594b2f.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1506 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1506-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nHere it is in action, cutting the kerf on a board that I'm going to resew with the frame saw. The wooden bolts lock the fence in place to get the desired line.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/7f8f3995a9.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1510 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1510-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nAnd that kerf gives you a good line all around the board to help keep the frame saw cutting true.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/107bd3e081.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1512 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1512-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nThe result is resawed boards that are far better than I'd get than without using the Kerfing Plane.\n\n <img src=\"uploads/2021/c06745364d.jpg\" alt=\"Kerfing planeIMG 1513 1024x768\" title=\"kerfing-planeIMG_1513-1024x768.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n",

I made the base with good plywood and the fences with hickory lined with wenge. The guide is also wenge. I choose hickory because I have a lot of it left over from my bow saw project. I choose wenge, because when I visited the Lie-Nielsen shop and saw their demo shooting board, it had wenge incorporated in it, and the person working there told me that wenge is a good choice because it stays true.

The aspect of this that I&rsquo;m most proud of is that it was made with handtools from start to finish, with one small exception which I&rsquo;ll detail below. It took about two months from start to finish, working on nights and weekends. I created this because I often tie flies away from home and I wanted a case that was easy to carry and also contained all the essential hardware. I also wanted a box that quickly converts to a tying station.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the finished product. I used about $50 of hardware from Rockler for the handle and the catches. The box is walnut, lined with cork on the bottom. The top is framed by walnut with cherry in the middle.

The raised L-shaped arm on the underside of the top is the tying station. There is also a swing-out arm with hand-made dowels to store/use 12 extra bobbins of thread, tinsel, wire, etc. The last &ldquo;dowel&rdquo; that you see in the front is made of metal. This metal dowel matches up with a rare-earth magnet on the underside of the base so it stays secured when swung in for storage.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/9973ef993f.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1059\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/9973ef993f.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>Here&rsquo;s the tying station set up for use with the tying vise in place, tools places in the holes in the L-shaped arm, and bobbins stacked on the swing-out holder. I also carved in three concave holes in the cherry base to hold various small tying items, and embedded a strong, long magnet on the insides across the front of the cherry base so that hooks are caught from falling on the floor. Lastly, I cut a shallow groove between the concave holders in back and the magnet in front so that if anything non-magnetic rolls (non-metal beads, mostly), they&rsquo;ll settle in the middle of the station and not roll onto the floor.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/0bba9f6c14.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1060\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/0bba9f6c14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>Here&rsquo;s a walk-through of how it was made.</p>\n\n<p>I started out with a bunch of walnut tongue and groove boards I was given by a neighbor.

I set outside dimensions and the height of the box (it had to be big enough to hold all my stuff and tall enough to store and mount my vise), but I didn&rsquo;t use a ruler to measure out anything else for the box. I  based every other cut by referencing from other parts.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/82e6c9d1ca.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1040\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/82e6c9d1ca.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a> <a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/b1f6abe6b9.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1041\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/b1f6abe6b9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>The hardest (manual) work in creating the box was resawing all the stock with my rip saw and planing it down to final dimensions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/57353c00f8.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1042\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/57353c00f8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>The bottom panel was glued up with hide glue (I used hide glue for the entire project).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/375a2bd0eb.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1044\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/375a2bd0eb.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>Then I cut all the dovetails for the box frame and the grooves to house the bottom panel.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/811940c425.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1043\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/811940c425.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>Here&rsquo;s the box in the process of being dry fit.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/4238b6c2f4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1045\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/4238b6c2f4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\" /></a>And here&rsquo;s the interior of the box all fit together, complete with the inner carrying compartment. The small compartment is sized to hold the fly tying vise clamp. The odd U-shaped bit and hole on the right side is custom-sized so that it perfectly fits my vise. The rest of the area is for tool storage. The outside L-shape is where the tying base mounted to the box top fits in for storage.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/dc444d66c4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1046\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/dc444d66c4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\" /></a>Then I lined the bottom with cork.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/ea46a73f05.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1048\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/ea46a73f05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\" /></a>The next image shows how much the storage compartment holds: the vise, the vise clamp, all my tools, and a bunch of extra stuff depending on what I might need for a particular session.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/822b6623c5.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1064\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/822b6623c5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"353\" /></a>Next, I started on the top of the box: walnut frame with mortises/tenons and a cherry panel.\n<a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/443981b76e.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1047\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/443981b76e.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\" /></a>Here is the top completed, exploded view.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/944a4400b0.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1049\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/944a4400b0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a> Here&rsquo;s the one spot where I had to use a power tool: a table saw. I needed to cut out a really big space to hold the hidden magnet, but it had to cut in a way that the top was really thin so that the magnet had enough strength through the wood to hold hooks and other metal objects on the base. I didn&rsquo;t try to do this by hand with such small margins. So I used the table saw to cut a deep groove, then used a &frac14;&rdquo; mortise to square up the hole so I could fit the magnet.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/ac1bb43c1b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1050\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/ac1bb43c1b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>After the top was completed, I then started working on the L-shaped tying station that mounts into the top. I used a Raamtang vise I made, ideal for holding small parts for shaping and planing down.\n<a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/fa0a61ce29.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1051\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/fa0a61ce29.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>here&rsquo;s the L-shaped tying station top, the bobbin holder, and the arms to attach it to the base with the mortises cut out.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/cd74dd4f54.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1053\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/cd74dd4f54.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>I cut out the dowel for the corner arm and the tiny dowels for the bobbin holder using a dowel maker from Lie-Nielsen.<a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/2a80223154.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1052\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/2a80223154.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>I also had to cut in a groove where the clamp fits on the tying station because I made it just a tad to short and there wasn&rsquo;t enough space to tighten the clamp. So this solved that small error.\n<a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/e6c8c05749.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1054\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/e6c8c05749.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>I finished it all up with Osmo polyx-oil.\n<a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/c24e1d7164.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1055\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/c24e1d7164.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a> <a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/eb6acfb1c2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1056\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/eb6acfb1c2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a></p>\n",

The small compartment is sized to hold the fly tying vise clamp. The odd U-shaped bit and hole on the right side is custom-sized so that it perfectly fits my vise. The rest of the area is for tool storage. The outside L-shape is where the tying base mounted to the box top fits in for storage.\n\n<a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/dc444d66c4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1046\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/dc444d66c4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\" /></a>Then I lined the bottom with cork.\n\n<a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/ea46a73f05.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1048\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/ea46a73f05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\" /></a>The next image shows how much the storage compartment holds: the vise, the vise clamp, all my tools, and a bunch of extra stuff depending on what I might need for a particular session.\n\n<a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/822b6623c5.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1064\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/822b6623c5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"353\" /></a>Next, I started on the top of the box: walnut frame with mortises/tenons and a cherry panel.\n<a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/443981b76e.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1047\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/443981b76e.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\" /></a>Here is the top completed, exploded view.\n\n<a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/944a4400b0.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1049\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/944a4400b0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a> Here's the one spot where I had to use a power tool: a table saw. I needed to cut out a really big space to hold the hidden magnet, but it had to cut in a way that the top was really thin so that the magnet had enough strength through the wood to hold hooks and other metal objects on the base. I didn't try to do this by hand with such small margins. So I used the table saw to cut a deep groove, then used a 1/4\" mortise to square up the hole so I could fit the magnet.\n\n<a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/ac1bb43c1b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1050\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/ac1bb43c1b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>After the top was completed, I then started working on the L-shaped tying station that mounts into the top. I used a Raamtang vise I made, ideal for holding small parts for shaping and planing down.\n<a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/fa0a61ce29.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1051\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/fa0a61ce29.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>here's the L-shaped tying station top, the bobbin holder, and the arms to attach it to the base with the mortises cut out.\n\n<a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/cd74dd4f54.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1053\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/cd74dd4f54.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>I cut out the dowel for the corner arm and the tiny dowels for the bobbin holder using a dowel maker from Lie-Nielsen.<a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/2a80223154.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1052\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/2a80223154.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>I also had to cut in a groove where the clamp fits on the tying station because I made it just a tad to short and there wasn't enough space to tighten the clamp. So this solved that small error.\n<a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/e6c8c05749.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1054\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/e6c8c05749.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>I finished it all up with Osmo polyx-oil.\n<a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/c24e1d7164.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1055\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/c24e1d7164.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a> <a href=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/eb6acfb1c2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1056\" src=\"https://troykitch.micro.blog/uploads/2021/eb6acfb1c2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>\n",
