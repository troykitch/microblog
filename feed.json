Also timely to read this article about Tuvalu in light of the recent adjustment of [the Doomsday Clock](https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/).\n\nI also recommend [The Long Now‚Äôs excellent podcast](https://longnow.org/seminars/podcast/).\n",

				"content_text": "This one is odd, but it serves a purpose. We have an elderly cat who has bad joints so has trouble eating. I set out to create an adjustable tray so he didn‚Äôt have to bend down to eat. Here's what I came up with. I made it tall enough to plan for the future (in case we end up getting a really large cat or a small dog someday in the future). Our cat can now comfortably eat while seated. The trays easily move up or down depending on the size of the bowl.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2022/0b16645c73.jpg\" alt=\"Cat1\" title=\"cat1.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1800\" height=\"2400\" />\n\nThe inspiration for this: I had two Harbor Freight bar clamps in my shop, shown below, which I never use because I don‚Äôt like to use them for work holding.

Studley (1838-1925) that many woodworkers know from his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->famous and mind-blowing tool chest<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>A member of my woodworking group spotted this article and suggested we embark on a group build. The bronze casting for the mallet cost $69 with shipping included. What an amazing opportunity and bargain! I received my bronze mallet head in the mail a couple of weeks ago and here&rsquo;s the mallet I made with it using bubinga, bocote wedges, and a handle with inset waxed cord. I just love how this came out and I&rsquo;m so grateful that Martley made this possible.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the mallet I made with the casting:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>And I&rsquo;ll briefly document the steps I took to make it.</p>\n<p>First off, here&rsquo;s the bronze casting as it arrived in the mail, along with the wood I selected to make the infill and handle. I went with bubinga.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the infill block sized to fit through the hole in the bronze head.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Next I chop out the through-mortise to match up with the hole where the handle will fit.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a view of the wooden insert with the mortise completed, mostly to show what the top and bottom of the casting looked like before I polished it up.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Now I began to shape handle, drawing out what I wanted in pencil.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a view of the handle, where I&rsquo;ve cut out the slot to fit into the bronze casting. I used my large tenon saw for this. I squared it all up with chisels.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Here it is all rough fit together. Looking like a mallet now.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Next, I shined it all up using a Dremel. Wow, what a difference. I left it rough, because I liked the look of it.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Now, onto the handle. I cut it out roughly with saw work, then filed down with my beloved <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Auriou rasps<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the handle, showing the cuts for the wedged tenons that&rsquo;ll go in the top to splay the wood out and hold it firm. The infill wood has not yet been cut to length.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Next, I decided to go with a wax cord wrap for the handle. I wanted it to sit flush, so I chiseled out the beginning and the end so it slopes inward from each side, so when I wrap the cord it&rsquo;ll gently slope upward. This will form a nice place to hold it.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>This image shows the beginning of the cord wrap, using tape to hold the ends in place. I wrapped the cord so tight, my hands cramped up.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>And here a few glamour shots of the completed mallet, which I finished with boiled linseed oil.

				"content_text": "A short article in the September/October 2021 issue of Popular Woodworking called attention to retired <a href=\"https://www.finewoodworking.com/forum/what-is-a-pattern-maker\">pattern maker</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mystic_pickers/\">Bill Martley's</a> project to reproduce the bronze head of the classic <a href=\"https://www.pressreader.com/usa/popular-woodworking/20210824/281625308326741\">Studley Mallet</a>, named after Henry O. Studley (1838-1925) that many woodworkers know from his <a href=\"https://lostartpress.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/virtuoso_excerpt.pdf\">famous and mind-blowing tool chest</a>.\n\nA member of my woodworking group spotted this article and suggested we embark on a group build. The bronze casting for the mallet cost $69 with shipping included. What an amazing opportunity and bargain! I received my bronze mallet head in the mail a couple of weeks ago and here's the mallet I made with it using bubinga, bocote wedges, and a handle with inset waxed cord. I just love how this came out and I'm so grateful that Martley made this possible.\n\nHere's the mallet I made with the casting:\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/1b4d987531.jpg\" alt=\"Studley malletimg16\" title=\"studley-malletimg16.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n\n\nAnd I'll briefly document the steps I took to make it.\n\n\nFirst off, here's the bronze casting as it arrived in the mail, along with the wood I selected to make the infill and handle. I went with bubinga.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/2eefdb4639.jpg\" alt=\"Studley malletimg1\" title=\"studley-malletimg1.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\nHere's the infill block sized to fit through the hole in the bronze head.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/cb5e6e83fe.jpg\" alt=\"Studley malletimg2\" title=\"studley-malletimg2.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\nNext I chop out the through-mortise to match up with the hole where the handle will fit. \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/f6844fe248.jpg\" alt=\"Studley malletimg3\" title=\"studley-malletimg3.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\nHere's a view of the wooden insert with the mortise completed, mostly to show what the top and bottom of the casting looked like before I polished it up.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/23c8205edc.jpg\" alt=\"Studley malletimg4\" title=\"studley-malletimg4.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\nNow I began to shape handle, drawing out what I wanted in pencil. \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/ff47d53b66.jpg\" alt=\"Studley malletimg5\" title=\"studley-malletimg5.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\nHere's a view of the handle, where I've cut out the slot to fit into the bronze casting. I used my large tenon saw for this. I squared it all up with chisels.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/12593d3264.jpg\" alt=\"Studley malletimg6\" title=\"studley-malletimg6.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\nHere it is all rough fit together. Looking like a mallet now.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/15752d99a7.jpg\" alt=\"Studley malletimg7\" title=\"studley-malletimg7.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" />\n\nNext, I shined it all up using a Dremel. Wow, what a difference. I left it rough, because I liked the look of it.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/e8eda2535d.jpg\" alt=\"Studley malletimg8\" title=\"studley-malletimg8.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\nNow, onto the handle. I cut it out roughly with saw work, then filed down with my beloved <a href=\"https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/tools/hand-tools/files-and-rasps/rasps/65242-auriou-cabinetmakers-rasps\">Auriou rasps</a>.\n\nHere's the handle, showing the cuts for the wedged tenons that'll go in the top to splay the wood out and hold it firm. The infill wood has not yet been cut to length.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/59016f2d96.jpg\" alt=\"Studley malletimg10\" title=\"studley-malletimg10.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\nNext, I decided to go with a wax cord wrap for the handle. I wanted it to sit flush, so I chiseled out the beginning and the end so it slopes inward from each side, so when I wrap the cord it'll gently slope upward. This will form a nice place to hold it.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/8a4ebcf438.jpg\" alt=\"Studley malletimg11\" title=\"studley-malletimg11.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\nThis image shows the beginning of the cord wrap, using tape to hold the ends in place. I wrapped the cord so tight, my hands cramped up.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/b896cce272.jpg\" alt=\"Studley malletimg12\" title=\"studley-malletimg12.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\nAnd here a few glamour shots of the completed mallet, which I finished with boiled linseed oil. Oh, and I forgot to mention, I've added the wedges here. The two top wedges are tiny slices of bocote, which I think contrasts nicely with the bubinga. It was a fun project, and now I have a small mallet with a lot of mass. It'll be a useful shop tool that I hope will still be in use by someone long after I'm gone.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/e58ff48b18.jpg\" alt=\"Studley malletimg13\" title=\"studley-malletimg13.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/8514610390.jpg\" alt=\"Studley malletimg14\" title=\"studley-malletimg14.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/03c9f76325.jpg\" alt=\"Studley malletimg15\" title=\"studley-malletimg15.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" />\n\n\n",

Here's what my computer keyboard set-up looked like before my project:</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/adb7ee2269.jpg\" alt=\"D8bf9746b2\" title=\"d8bf9746b2.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\n<p>Backstory: I use an <a href=\"https://ergodox-ez.com\">ErgoDox EZ split keyboard</a> with an Apple trackpad in between (yes ... I use a trackpad and a mouse, for reasons). One problem: I'm pretty particular about my keyboard layout, so I like to have the angle of each side of the keyboard and the wrist rests just so. But each wrist rest and each keyboard half are free floating so they are always moving around. This is especially annoying when I need to move this stuff out of the way to clean underneath, or to use my <a href=\"https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=3917\">secondary mechanical keyboard</a>. Another problem: the trackpad in the center is too low, weirdly placed, and is just not great. So I came up with this odd thing:</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/bf4051db8a.jpg\" alt=\"2ab01a01c2\" title=\"2ab01a01c2.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\n<p>This was an interesting little challenge to create using hand tools. But it was worth the effort. Now when I need to move my rather elaborate keyboard set up out of the way to clean underneath, or when I want more desk space for a non-computer task, or to switch keyboards, I can quickly set things back up with the exact spacing and angling I want. I start by placing the wrist rests:</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/07f54e3313.jpg\" alt=\"478afbdc0f\" title=\"478afbdc0f.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\n<p>And then place each keyboard half against the wrist rests:</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/c637931068.jpg\" alt=\"2b61e56ca5\" title=\"2b61e56ca5.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\n<p>And then place the trackpad on the raised, angled stand in the middle. The cable that connects the two keyboard parts tucks neatly under the trackpad. I wanted to keep this as minimalist as possible, so I made it so that the trackpad front edge rests on the stand, but it's angled so that the trackpad back edge rests perfectly on the keyboard edges. This is the minimal width to fit the trackpad and the spacing is just right (for me) for typing. It is very stable and feels solid.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/8faaac99f5.jpg\" alt=\"6ac1991e44\" title=\"6ac1991e44.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\n<p>So I'm going to use this for a few days and make sure I like it, then I'll finalize everything, glue it up, give it a coat of Osmo. Based on a few hours of usage, I think this will be a good solution. Everything lines up just so and it just takes a few seconds to get all assembled. It also looks much neater.</p>\n",

The unmarked keys on the board did not take as much time to adjust to as I thought they would.

My solution was to get a <a href=\"https://techkeys.us/products/sixkeyboard\">tiny six key customizable keyboard from TechKeys</a>. It fits perfectly in between the two keyboard halves. In addition to the arrow keys, I programmed the top left and right keys with an extra shift and space, because it's often quicker to tap the tiny board when arrowing around. I think it's an amazing set-up. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now I just need to get some custom keycaps for the tiny board. I'm currently using leftover keys from my <a href=\"https://techkeys.us/products/sixkeyboard\">Vortex Race 3</a>. Why two mechanical keyboards? I have a standing desk station and a sitting desk station. I use the Vortex while sitting, the Ergodox while standing. Excessive? Perhaps. But the Ergodox is not the easiest keyboard to move around, so this works for me. Plus ... I just love mechanical keyboards. It's a bit of an addiction.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

The fly rod/reel this case is designed to display is raffled off once a year. The person who wins the raffle gets to use it for one year.¬†The prize comes with a small book to log fishing experiences. At the club's annual banquet, the person who used it for a year gives a short presentation of his or her experiences.¬†</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To get me started on this rod/reel case, I was provided with some photos of a similar box from a fly club in Pennsylvania.

My old one was created over a year ago and I skimped and made the fence with douglas fir, which didn&rsquo;t hold up well at all. Plus, it just wasn&rsquo;t that well constructed and I wasn&rsquo;t able to get great results with it. As I&rsquo;m about to start a project which will require lots of shooting, I decided to do this now.</p>\n<p>So I did a search for &ldquo;shooting board designs&rdquo; and came across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this one<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is a plan I didn&rsquo;t purchase (but the photo on the page was enough to inspire me). I made the base with good plywood and the fences with hickory lined with wenge. The guide is also wenge. I choose hickory because I have a lot of it left over from my bow saw project. I choose wenge, because when I visited the Lie-Nielsen shop and saw their demo shooting board, it had wenge incorporated in it, and the person working there told me that wenge is a good choice because it stays true. That was enough to convince me, and I happen to have wenge.</p>\n<p>I thought I was going to have buy some parts to make a detachable miter fence, but then it occured to me that I already have a couple of featherboards for a router table that I NEVER use, so I could steal the hardware from that and use it for my project. By chance, I already had a couple of longer carriage bolts that fit perfectly:</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So here is the completed shooting board without the miter fence:</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here it is with the miter fence:\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And here it is on edge, in storage position (added a groove in the front to snuggly hold the miter bits.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I did some test cuts today and it&rsquo;s great. I&rsquo;m quite happy with it. One thing about it: the board is smallish. Not a big deal for squaring an edge with long pieces because it&rsquo;s easy to stick in some support on the bench. But when shooting miters on longer boards, the ends are going to hanging in the air of the table. So the way I&rsquo;m dealing with that is with my shop bent. I didn&rsquo;t glue up the top piece in my bent so it can be removed:</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The &ldquo;standard&rdquo; height of it lines up with my bench top, but I can swap it out for different heights. So now I just need to make a new top piece that is a few inches taller for when I need to support longer pieces for miter cuts. As an aside, I made the bent this way because my other small bench in the shop is a different height, so I have a top part that matches the height of that for those times I need to support things on that surface.</p>\n",

As I'm about to start a project which will require lots of shooting, I decided to do this now.\n\nSo I did a search for \"shooting board designs\" and came across <a href=\"http://refinededge.com/shooting-board-plan/\">this one</a>, which is a plan I didn't purchase (but the photo on the page was enough to inspire me). I made the base with good plywood and the fences with hickory lined with wenge. The guide is also wenge. I choose hickory because I have a lot of it left over from my bow saw project. I choose wenge, because when I visited the Lie-Nielsen shop and saw their demo shooting board, it had wenge incorporated in it, and the person working there told me that wenge is a good choice because it stays true. That was enough to convince me, and I happen to have wenge.\n\nI thought I was going to have buy some parts to make a detachable miter fence, but then it occured to me that I already have a couple of featherboards for a router table that I NEVER use, so I could steal the hardware from that and use it for my project. By chance, I already had a couple of longer carriage bolts that fit perfectly:\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/46e0a81875.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1117\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/46e0a81875.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></a>So here is the completed shooting board without the miter fence:\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/e9e3b1387b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1115\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/e9e3b1387b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></a>Here it is with the miter fence:\n<a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/647b884501.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1116\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/647b884501.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>And here it is on edge, in storage position (added a groove in the front to snuggly hold the miter bits.\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/596896a14b.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1114\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/596896a14b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></a>I did some test cuts today and it's great. I'm quite happy with it. One thing about it: the board is smallish. Not a big deal for squaring an edge with long pieces because it's easy to stick in some support on the bench. But when shooting miters on longer boards, the ends are going to hanging in the air of the table. So the way I'm dealing with that is with my shop bent. I didn't glue up the top piece in my bent so it can be removed:\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/55c2f703ed.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1118\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/55c2f703ed.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></a>The \"standard\" height of it lines up with my bench top, but I can swap it out for different heights. So now I just need to make a new top piece that is a few inches taller for when I need to support longer pieces for miter cuts. As an aside, I made the bent this way because my other small bench in the shop is a different height, so I have a top part that matches the height of that for those times I need to support things on that surface.\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I have a new fly tying box. The aspect of this that I&rsquo;m most proud of is that it was made with handtools from start to finish, with one small exception which I&rsquo;ll detail below. It took about two months from start to finish, working on nights and weekends. I created this because I often tie flies away from home and I wanted a case that was easy to carry and also contained all the essential hardware. I also wanted a box that quickly converts to a tying station.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the finished product. I used about $50 of hardware from Rockler for the handle and the catches. The box is walnut, lined with cork on the bottom. The top is framed by walnut with cherry in the middle. Here&rsquo;s the front:</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s the back:</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And here it is opened up. The raised L-shaped arm on the underside of the top is the tying station. There is also a swing-out arm with hand-made dowels to store/use 12 extra bobbins of thread, tinsel, wire, etc. The last &ldquo;dowel&rdquo; that you see in the front is made of metal. This metal dowel matches up with a rare-earth magnet on the underside of the base so it stays secured when swung in for storage.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s the tying station set up for use with the tying vise in place, tools places in the holes in the L-shaped arm, and bobbins stacked on the swing-out holder. I also carved in three concave holes in the cherry base to hold various small tying items, and embedded a strong, long magnet on the insides across the front of the cherry base so that hooks are caught from falling on the floor. Lastly, I cut a shallow groove between the concave holders in back and the magnet in front so that if anything non-magnetic rolls (non-metal beads, mostly), they&rsquo;ll settle in the middle of the station and not roll onto the floor.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s a walk-through of how it was made.</p>\n<p>I started out with a bunch of walnut tongue and groove boards I was given by a neighbor. I had a rough piece of cherry also, not pictured here.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I then drew up a rough plan of what I wanted. I set outside dimensions and the height of the box (it had to be big enough to hold all my stuff and tall enough to store and mount my vise), but I didn&rsquo;t use a ruler to measure out anything else for the box. I¬† based every other cut by referencing from other parts.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The hardest (manual) work in creating the box was resawing all the stock with my rip saw and planing it down to final dimensions.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The bottom panel was glued up with hide glue (I used hide glue for the entire project).</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then I cut all the dovetails for the box frame and the grooves to house the bottom panel.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s the box in the process of being dry fit.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And here&rsquo;s the interior of the box all fit together, complete with the inner carrying compartment.

				"content_text": "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1060\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/0bba9f6c14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nI have a new fly tying box. The aspect of this that I'm most proud of is that it was made with handtools from start to finish, with one small exception which I'll detail below. It took about two months from start to finish, working on nights and weekends. I created this because I often tie flies away from home and I wanted a case that was easy to carry and also contained all the essential hardware. I also wanted a box that quickly converts to a tying station.\n\nHere's the finished product. I used about $50 of hardware from Rockler for the handle and the catches. The box is walnut, lined with cork on the bottom. The top is framed by walnut with cherry in the middle. Here's the front:\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/2d5dc891ce.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1058\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/2d5dc891ce.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>Here's the back:\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/dca2a8cbc5.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1057\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/dca2a8cbc5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>And here it is opened up. The raised L-shaped arm on the underside of the top is the tying station. There is also a swing-out arm with hand-made dowels to store/use 12 extra bobbins of thread, tinsel, wire, etc. The last \"dowel\" that you see in the front is made of metal. This metal dowel matches up with a rare-earth magnet on the underside of the base so it stays secured when swung in for storage.\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/9973ef993f.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1059\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/9973ef993f.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>Here's the tying station set up for use with the tying vise in place, tools places in the holes in the L-shaped arm, and bobbins stacked on the swing-out holder. I also carved in three concave holes in the cherry base to hold various small tying items, and embedded a strong, long magnet on the insides across the front of the cherry base so that hooks are caught from falling on the floor. Lastly, I cut a shallow groove between the concave holders in back and the magnet in front so that if anything non-magnetic rolls (non-metal beads, mostly), they'll settle in the middle of the station and not roll onto the floor.\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/0bba9f6c14.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1060\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/0bba9f6c14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>Here's a walk-through of how it was made.\n\nI started out with a bunch of walnut tongue and groove boards I was given by a neighbor. I had a rough piece of cherry also, not pictured here.\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/f44360b6c1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1039\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/f44360b6c1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>I then drew up a rough plan of what I wanted. I set outside dimensions and the height of the box (it had to be big enough to hold all my stuff and tall enough to store and mount my vise), but I didn't use a ruler to measure out anything else for the box. I¬† based every other cut by referencing from other parts.\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/82e6c9d1ca.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1040\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/82e6c9d1ca.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a> <a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/b1f6abe6b9.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1041\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/b1f6abe6b9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>The hardest (manual) work in creating the box was resawing all the stock with my rip saw and planing it down to final dimensions.\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/57353c00f8.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1042\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/57353c00f8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>The bottom panel was glued up with hide glue (I used hide glue for the entire project).\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/375a2bd0eb.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1044\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/375a2bd0eb.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>Then I cut all the dovetails for the box frame and the grooves to house the bottom panel.\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/811940c425.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1043\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/811940c425.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a>Here's the box in the process of being dry fit.\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/4238b6c2f4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1045\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/4238b6c2f4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\" /></a>And here's the interior of the box all fit together, complete with the inner carrying compartment.

Too many of the journalists I‚Äôve seen try to make the transition to running their own blogs and websites remain mired in the ‚Äústory‚Äù mindset, endlessly creating newspaper-style ‚Äústories‚Äù or even brief-length snippets for their blogs. But they fail to create assets of enduring value that ultimately provide the income that they need to remain viable businesses online.</blockquote>\nThis is as true for online publishing as it is for any other online content. Assets that have enduring value keep people coming back. But I'd add that creating a good story, or narrative, to support your assets is just as important. Teehan+Lax is a great example of how this is done. Read their 'behind-the-scene' story about <a href=\"http://www.teehanlax.com/story/medium/\">how they designed Medium</a>¬†to see what I mean.\n",

Bruce Sterling explains it well in a <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2012/09/the-center-for-science-and-the-imagination/\">2012 Wired article</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hieroglyph.asu.edu/2013/03/welcome/#comment-25\">goal</a> of the Hieroglyph Project is to rekindle the spirit of mid-20th century \"Big Idea\" science fiction: the kind of writing that described (and inspired) a future society in which communications satellites, robots, and rocket ships were common technologies. The idea of Hieroglyph, then, is to provide a forum for 21st-century writers and researchers to dream up <em>new</em> big ideas to inspire <em>new</em> generations of engineers and scientists. To give you an idea of the scope and vision we're talking about here, two initial projects are an <a href=\"http://hieroglyph.asu.edu/project/the-tall-tower/\">insanely tall tower</a> and a plot to send a <a href=\"http://hieroglyph.asu.edu/project/stereolunagraphy/\">3D printer to the moon</a>. Here's an excerpt from the project's '<a href=\"http://hieroglyph.asu.edu/about/\">about</a>' page:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What science fiction stories‚Äîand the symbols that they engender‚Äîcan do better than almost anything else is to provide not just an idea for some specific technical innovation, but also to supply a coherent picture of that innovation being integrated into a society, into an economy, and into people‚Äôs lives. Often, this is the missing element that scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and entrepreneurs need in order to actually take the first real steps towards realizing some novel idea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This should be interesting.</p>\n",

This weekend's special offer means that, for a year, you may add as many books as you want. If you don't pay anything after the year is up, your books won't be deleted, but you won't be able to add more. What's the money for? From the<a href=\"http://www.librarything.com/blogs/librarything/\"> LibraryThing blog</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The money helps pay for the site, and keeps us advertisement-free for members. Also, we believe customers should be customers, with the loyalty and rights of customers, not the thing we sell to our real customers.</p>\n</blockquote><p>You can join the discussion on what the Amazon purchase of GoodReads means for LibraryThing (and ponder broader questions about Amazon's increasing dominance in the publishing/bookselling world)&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.librarything.com/topic/152033\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>A couple of days ago, <a href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2013/03/the_zen_wisdom_of_alan_watts_animated_by_creators_of_south_park.html\">Open Culture highlighted</a> some Alan Watts talks that were animated by the creators of South Park back in 2007. That was news to me. What an unexpected pairing. If you enjoy these videos, be sure to see the 'related content' links at the end of the Open Culture <a href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2013/03/the_zen_wisdom_of_alan_watts_animated_by_creators_of_south_park.html\">post</a>. </p>\n\n<p>My exploration of the quirky, entertaining, informative, and often enlightening talks of Alan Watts began about 12 years ago when I started studying Zen Buddhism with his introductory book, 'The Way of Zen.' That fairly dry book led me to a raft of Watts audio recordings. Listening to a Watts lecture is a completely different experience. You may not agree with everything that he has to say, but it may lead you to think about the world quite differently. I think the bulk of his talks stand the test of time (although you may notice beat generation lingo and the occasional anecdote that would be considered quite politically incorrect by today's standards).</p>\n\n<p>If you're unfamiliar with Watts, YouTube is a good place to start for some free content. Despite what some of the online fan comments convey, it helps to know that Watts didn't see himself as any kind of a guru. He said he was a mere 'spiritual entertainer' with 'nothing to sell.' Alas, decades after his death, the Alan Watts collection of audio recordings are <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20120715234350/http://www.openculture.com/2012/07/alan_watts_and_his_zen_wisdom_animated_by_creators_of_south_park.html\">now for sale</a> (and they aren't particularly cheap). Years ago, I subscribed to a free Watts podcast that presented highlights from many of his talks. I checked to see if it still existed today. Apparently it does, but it appears that it has only recently been <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/alan-watts-podcast/id119777571?mt=2\">relaunched</a> or refreshed. There is only one available episode which was published just a few days ago. </p>\n\n<p>I was surprised to see that the people behind the podcast and the audio collections (the primary being Mark Watts, son of Alan Watts) also offer an iOS app which, while also <a href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2012/07/alan_watts_and_his_zen_wisdom_animated_by_creators_of_south_park.html\">pricey</a>, does include 21 hours of lectures. I admit that I've added this app to my 'maybe someday' list. I also own a lengthy <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/audiobook/youre-it!-on-hiding-seeking/id350916892\">audiobook</a> that I think is worth the price of admission, given that I've listened to parts of it many times. Final note: looks like the nonprofit behind all of this Watts merch, curiously called the 'Electronic University,' has <a href=\"http://www.alanwatts.org/center.php\">big plans for the future</a>. At least we know they aren't spending it on pizza and beer.</p>\n",

A few of the more intriguing choices are <a href=\"http://www.feedly.com/\">Feedly</a>, <a href=\"https://feedbin.me/\">Feedbin</a>, <a href=\"http://www.feedafever.com/\">Fever</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.newsblur.com/\">NewsBlur</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Like many users, I never actually visit my Google Reader page. I rely on third-party services that suck in my Google Reader subscriptions. For the desktop, I use Feedly. For iOS, I use <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a>. Will it matter that I'm no longer using Google Reader on the back-end? Not really. I take solace knowing that I'll be using fewer Google services. My main concern is that this may be part of a broader trend with Google: trying to funnel us all into Google+ and clamping down on how (and if) third parties can use Google services. I wouldn't be all that surprised if Google were to lock down Gmail someday soon so that it could only be accessed via Google's mobile apps or their web-based service. It is an ad-based company, after all.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, of the many alternative news aggregator services, my bet is that Feedly will rise to the top of the pack in terms of popularity. They're poised to <a href=\"http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/14/google-reader/\">seamlessly transition</a> existing Google Readers (without any required user action). That's very handy, but it would only go so far if the service was so-so. On that front, I think the Feedly experience is one of the best out there. It looks great, it's easy to customize to fit different workflows and visual preferences, and they're aggressively honing the service to make it better.  </p>\n\n<p>As an example of this, I've just rediscovered Feedly's mobile apps. I've used Feedly on the desktop for quite a while and like how easy it is to view and manage feeds in various ways. While I tried the Feedly iOS apps early on in their history, I wasn't drawn in. Reeder was still a better experience on iOS. However, I tried the apps again last night. I'm glad I did. These apps have come a long way and I'm fairly convinced that they'll work for me quite well. </p>\n\n<p>As an aside, I also enjoy news aggregation services like <a href=\"http://www.zite.com/\">Zite</a> and <a href=\"http://getprismatic.com/\">Prismatic</a>, but I tend to put these sort of services in a different category as they focus on presenting stories based on reader interests. They are fantastic for discovery and casual browsing and are certainly worth a look. Lastly, you may note that I haven't mentioned <a href=\"http://flipboard.com/\">Flipboard</a> anywhere in this article. I must be one of the few people out there who just don't care for it. Nothing personal, Flipboard. I note it here, though, because it's an alternative highly-regarded reader that is also certainly worth a test drive.</p><ul class=\"sqs-tagcloud\">\n\n</ul>\n",

				"content_text": "<img src=\"http://vfd.troykitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/rockwall.jpg\" /><p>Last December, my wife came across an ad on Craigslist for free fieldstone. On a whim, I decided to haul it home to build a wall. As is so often the case with DIY, it was easier to concieve than to execute. I finished my small wall only a few days ago. It took me nearly four months. </p>\n\n<p>The steps for building a dry wall are fairly straightforward. The essence of it: stake out the wall line; dig a trench about eight inches deep and a bit wider than the planned wall; fill the trench with crushed gravel to form a base that will minimize shifting from frost heaves and settling; then stack rocks. The basic rule of rock stacking is to place one stone over sections where two stones come together, and two stones over sections where there is one stone. Cap the top with heavy, nice-looking stone. The overall pattern should be stable, level, and visually appealing. </p>\n\n<p>That last part is the kicker. In my case, I had to contend with a three foot downhill slope in the front of the house and a one foot incline on the part that curves around the odd looking conifer at the corner, which is called a Weeping Blue Atlas Cedar. A flat wall would have been challenging enough, but the sloping ground added much complexity.</p><img src=\"http://vfd.troykitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/rocks2.jpg\" /><p>My goal was to place the stones in a cascading fashion so that they conformed to the slope of the land. That entailed placing some rocks, stepping back for a wider view from various angles, deciding it <em>wasn't quite right</em>, tearing down parts that looked unnatural, choosing different rocks, then rebuilding the offending section. Then I'd build another small section and repeat the process. Over and over and over. &nbsp;</p><p>I think the resulting wall looks nice, although I'm sure it would look nicer if a professional installed it. It might also be more structurally sound. Time will tell how well my amateur job holds up. I suspect I'll know in about a year. That length of time will test the wall against the stress of changing temperatures, weather, and frost. The great part about a dry stone wall, though, is that there is no mortar. I can always adjust it. I like to think of it as a rock garden in the shape of a wall.&nbsp;</p><p></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.cultofmac.com/174088/apples-podcasting-stroke-of-genius/\">Mike Elgan wrote an interesting piece on Cult of Mac </a>recently&nbsp;that lays out a possible path forward for Apple with regards to the humble podcast.&nbsp;If you haven't heard, it appears that Apple will break podcasts out into a separate app with the release of iOS 6. This will help to lighten up the iTunes app, which is arguably a bit crowded and unwieldy. That's a good thing, but what will become of the podcast? &nbsp;It could go the way of iTunesU, which was stripped out of the iTunes app not too long ago and is now offered as an optional download. That's what we could call the 'demotion to obscurity' path. As Elgan points out, this made sense for iTunesU because the user base for lectures is narrow. For podcasts, however, such a move might signal that Apple doesn't really care about the podcast medium, choosing instead to focus only on content that makes them money. It might, in short, spell the beginning of the end for the podcast. In less dire terms, it certainly wouldn't help podcast listenership to grow beyond a relatively small but enthusiastic group of people.</p>\n<p>An alternative path might feature a new iOS 6 podcast app that is installed by default with iOS 6, forming the centerpiece of a new content strategy for Apple that combines free podcasts with paid audio. This is Elgan's speculation, and I think he's on to something. He essentially says that such a strategy could herald a new dawn for podcasts, in which Apple sets the stage to compete with Audible (by wrapping in Apple audiobooks with the podcast app and cutting ties with Amazon's competing Audible service); integrate podcasts and other audio content with car stereos employing Siri control (because that's where a lot of people listen to audio); and adopt the name 'iPodcasts' or 'iPodcast' to brand the new app (which, Elgan surmises, might give Apple more footing to go after companies profiting by using the word 'pod' in their products and services).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As it now stands, podcast enthusiasts (like me) mostly feel that Apple thinks little of podcasts. In iTunes terms, the podcast is one step up from the 'Radio' category. When was the last time you used <em>that</em> feature? It's a shame, because podcasts serve up consistently great and varied content.&nbsp;I currently subscribe to 41 podcasts. For years, I relied on iTunes for podcast content. And, for years, I've cursed at how poorly iTunes manages podcasts and fails at helping people discover great shows.</p>\n<p>Recently, I switched from iTunes to so-called 'podcatcher' apps. I purchased <a href=\"http://www.joeisanerd.com/apps/icatcher/\">iCatcher!</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://downcastapp.com/\">Downcast</a> and tried each out for several weeks. I would recommend them both, really. They are solid apps. Having said that, I'm currently using Downcast as my podcatcher of choice because it's a bit more polished and syncs faster across devices via iCloud. What do podcatcher apps offer over iTunes? Well, syncing across devices for starters. I can stop listening to a podcast on my iPhone and pick up where I left off on my iPad. I can download podcasts (of any size) over 3G. I can manage my podcasts by playlist. I enjoy automatic, untethered podcast updating over WiFi. I could go on. Suffice it to say that Apple's podcast offerings pale in comparison.</p>\n<p>If Apple does stake a claim on 'iPodcast' and rolls out a new app this Fall that consolidates both free podcast and paid spoken word content, it would surely be a good thing for the future of the podcast. Of course, it could also mean that apps like Downcast and iCatcher will soon be <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sherlocked\">Sherlocked</a>. And it could also mean that fewer and fewer podcasts would be free in the future, as this might give podcast producers an easy way to charge for episodes without creating stand-alone apps. Who knows. What I do sense is that, as&nbsp;a consumer and <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/noaas-national-ocean-service/id304735817\">producer</a> of podcasts and big fan of spoken word content, this medium is undervalued and underappreciated.&nbsp;</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<div id=\"_mcePaste\">A few loosely-formed notes related to Apple's latest announcements:</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\"></div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>The Retina Macbook Pro is lovely. I'm not planning on purchasing it, though. If I were going to get it, I'd spring for expensive upgrades (16 GB of RAM, largest hard drive), as I've read that there is apparently no way to upgrade this machine. I also have a more existential concern: if were to buy a Retina laptop, would I still be able to tolerate my crappy external monitor?&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The $20 upgrade fee to install Mountain Lion on all your Macs is a good deal.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>I'm lamenting the unmistakable signs that the desktop hierarchical file system is going the way of the floppy drive. App libraries are in, in which each app houses its own files and data, iOS style. &nbsp;I suspect that, within the next iteration or two of OS X, the file system will join Console, Terminal, and Activity Monitor in the utility bin. And as with most Mac utilities, it probably won't be used by many. Still, as long as access to the file system remains, I'll be OK.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Here's one thing that worries me about app libraries. A lot of people organize files on the Mac by topic, not by app. For example, I have documents (created with many different apps) that are related to my house that I've tagged and filed away in one place. How will a walled-in app library solution allow me to organize documents across apps? Maybe a tagging solution will be offered.&nbsp;And what of plain text files, which may be opened and manipulated by scores of iOS and desktop apps? That's the beauty of the flexibility of Dropbox text file storage. It's so very flexible.</li>\n<li>Speaking of files, I love my PathFinder. And EagleFiler. And Launchbar. With every OS X release, my insecurity grows about the future of these and many other desktop apps. Imagine how the developers feel.</li>\n<li>Every time I see more iOS features come to the desktop, I can't help but think, 'Winter is coming!'</li>\n<li>Apple demos of new OS features are consistently drool-worthy and slick, but they need to help us users more in terms of follow-through. My point is that Apple could do a much better job in documenting how to use their apps and operating systems. Updates come fast and furious, but new features and usage scenarios are poorly documented.</li>\n<li>I'm surprised that Apple has yet to offer a better password solution for logging in to web-based accounts across devices. Stated another way, I'm surprised that Apple hasn't yet Sherlocked 1Password. Couldn't you see Apple offering a password solution that syncs across your Mac(s) and devices via iCloud, but only works with Safari to encourage browser lock-in. Speaking of, does anyone know of a site that lists all third party apps that have been Sherlocked over the years?</li>\n<li>Passbook looks promising. I hope it expands to include supermarkets, chain stores, and gas station membership bar codes. It's the 21st century. Why do I still need a Petco plastic dongle on my car keychain?</li>\n<li>What of Dragon Dictate? Curious that I received a newsletter from Nuance for the first time in a long while on the day of the WWDC keynote offering a special discount to buy Dictate for Father's Day. And I received another similar email today. So I'm wondering if the new OS X dictation feature will obviate the need for Dragon Dictate ... or if this product will differentiate itself by offering a more robust voice-recognition package for Mac. I should note that I'm a happy Dragon Dictate user.</li>\n<li>Facebook integration thoughts: blah. I'm not a fan.</li>\n<li>Siri's new ability to open an app by name isn't enough. What if I don't remember the name of the app? This is a good step forward, but we need more and better ways to navigate our hundreds of iOS apps. By keyword, for example. Wouldn't it be nice to ask Siri to serve up all weather-related or board game apps?</li>\n<li>The Mac Pro update was weak. Did you see that the Mac Pro had a little 'new' tag on it in the Apple Store on the day of the keynote? The next day, that notation disappeared&nbsp;... no doubt because of the deluge of feedback from outraged power users who were expecting a real update. That won't come, apparently, until next year.</li>\n<li>iTunes remains a bloated mess.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>When on Earth is the iWorks desktop suite going to be refreshed?</li>\n<li>iOS, iTunes, iLife, iEverything. Am I the only one who is sick of the 'i' thing?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><em>Wow. I haven't posted in quite a while. Been busy with other projects. Here's a little item that I drafted a long while back but never posted:</em></p>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\"><a href=\"http://edge.org/\">Edge.org</a> published an <a href=\"http://edge.org/conversation/a-universe-of-self-replicating-code\">interview</a>&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">recently</span> with science historian George Dyson about self-replicating code. The theme is that that we tend to talk about the digital universe abstractly, metaphorically, and by discussing how it affects us. Dyson says we're asking the wrong questions. What we need to do is study our digital universe objectively, like scientists do, because:</div>\n<div></div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\"></div>\n<blockquote>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">...the same way life found a way to use the self-replicating qualities of these polynucleotide molecules to the great benefit of life as a whole, there's no reason life won't use the self-replicating abilities of digital code, and that's what's happening.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div></div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\"></div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\"></div>\n<p>Dyson's discussion about what's now driving the growth and evolution of the digital universe was, for me, unexpected. He said that the first great leap in our digital universe originated with Alan Turing (who would have been 100 this year), who is often cited as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence. The next leap came from John Von Neumann, an unbelievably prolific mathematician who fathered, among other things, game theory. He also mathematically described the structure of self-replication before the structure of DNA was even discovered.&nbsp;So who will take the next big leap forward? Dyson says to expect someone working in advertising. Yes, advertising.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">What's the driver today? You want one word? It's advertising. And, you may think advertising is very trivial, and of no real importance, but I think it's the driver. If you look at what most of these codes are doing, they're trying to get the audience, trying to deliver the audience. The money is flowing as advertising. And it is interesting that Samuel Butler imagined all this in 1863, and then in his book Erewhon. And then 1901, before he died, he wrote a draft for \"Erewhon Revisited.\" In there, he called out advertising, saying that advertising would be the driving force of these machines evolving and taking over the world. Even then at the close of 19th century England, he saw advertising as the way we would grant power to the machines.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div></div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\"></div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Now that's something I did not expect. Now consider this section, which took me some time to wrap my head around:&nbsp;</div>\n<div></div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\"></div>\n<blockquote>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Very few people are looking at this digital universe in an objective way. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Hillis\">Danny Hillis</a> is one of the few people who is. His comment, made exactly 30 years ago in 1982, was that \"memory locations are just wires turned sideways in time\". That's just so profound. That should be engraved on the wall. Because we don't realize that there is this very different universe that does not have the same physics as our universe. It's completely different physics. Yet, from the perspective of that universe, there is physics, and we have almost no physicists looking at it, as to what it's like. And if we want to understand the sort of organisms that would evolve in that totally different universe, you have to understand the physics of the world in which they are in. &nbsp;It's like looking for life on another planet. Danny has that perspective. Most people say just, \"well, a wire is a wire. It's not a memory location turned sideways in time.\" You have to have that sort of relativistic view of things.</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\"></div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\"></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At some point while pondering this paragraph, a Proust quote popped into my head: \"The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new lands but seeing with new eyes.\" This comes from 'In Search of Lost Time,' which helped to popularize the the idea of involuntary memory, often revealed in this Proustian tome through dreams. And that made me think, as a science fiction fan, of Phillip K. Dick's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,' which somehow seemed apropros here.&nbsp;At any rate, here's a link to a good companion piece to this article, a TED presentation by Kevin Slavin: '<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_slavin_how_algorithms_shape_our_world.html\">How algorithms shape our world.</a>'</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Over the years, I've honed my HTML and CSS skills through trial and error, repetition, books, online courses, and by tapping the expertise of colleagues.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #101010;\">But JavaScript? I'm not so good with that. Sure, I can deploy a jQuery plugin and fiddle with parameters. And I know a bit of PHP (enough to get me in trouble, as they say). In most cases, I can decipher code, copy what I need, and modify it to meet my needs &hellip; as long as I don&rsquo;t have to change too much. But my depth of understanding is shallow, which is something I&rsquo;ve long wanted to remedy. Now I feel like I'm really making some progress with <a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com/\"><span style=\"color: #0200e9;\">Codecademy</span></a>, a free online &lsquo;academy&rsquo; aimed at teaching basic programming skills. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #101010;\">Codecademy gets it right. For starters, you aren&rsquo;t required to sign up for an account prior to beginning lessons. Instead, you can dive right in by typing your name in the site&rsquo;s integrated editor. Entering your name is your first lesson. Only later, after completing a few exercises, are you prompted to sign up for a free account (which you only need to do if you want to keep tabs on your progress). At this point, you&rsquo;ll have a good idea if this is for you. While this is a relatively minor detail, it&rsquo;s a thoughtful touch that underscores how this is a different kind of training tool.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #101010;\">Lessons are divided into topical sections that grow in complexity as you progress. At each step of the way, accompanying text explains what&rsquo;s going on and why. Within a few days, you&rsquo;re writing simple programs that tie together all that you&rsquo;ve learned up to that point.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #101010;\">While there are badges for completing sections, progress meters, and a point scoring system to help keep motivation up, the real driver &ndash; and the heart of Codecademy &ndash; is the integrated editor that accompanies each lesson. Rather, the integrated editor really <em>is</em> the lesson. You read a short bit of natural language text explaining a concept or new syntax, and then you&rsquo;re asked to write some code to demonstrate comprehension. Everything you learn, in other words, you learn by doing yourself. You can&rsquo;t move on to the next lesson unless you get the code right. This real-time feedback works.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #101010;\">There&rsquo;s a lot of course material available, which is growing exponentially thanks to the addition of crowdsourced exercises submitted by other developers. User forums are active, so you can get help when you get stuck or need something clarified. Right now, only JavaScript lessons are available, with Python and Ruby courses to come later. I reckon these lessons will keep me occupied and learning for a long time to come. The best part is that the people behind Codecademy say they&rsquo;re committed to keeping this learning resource free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #101010;\">More than other online courses, videos and books that I&rsquo;ve tried over the years, Codecademy fosters a clearer understanding of <em>what</em> it is that I&rsquo;m doing and<em> why </em>I'm doing it because it is, quite literally, engaging. It&rsquo;s not that other courses I&rsquo;ve taken are not good, it&rsquo;s that the Codecademy model is particularly good.</span></p>\n",

If you're not familiar with last week's mute switch controversy, start with <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2012/01/iphone_mute_switch_design\" target=\"_blank\">this post from John Gruber</a>. Then read <a href=\"http://ihnatko.com/2012/01/14/daring-fireball-on-the-behavior-of-the-iphone-mute-switch/\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Ihnatko's post</a>. Finally, read <a href=\"http://hivelogic.com/articles/mute/\" target=\"_blank\">Dan Benjamin's take</a>.</p><p>I agree that you can't design around every edge case, and it's logical to assume that most people want alarms to make noise so important events are not missed (e.g., waking up in the morning). I am such a user. I typically leave silent mode engaged, but I rely on my phone to wake me up for work. That said, I'm sure that many users will naturally assume that the 'mute' button on the iPhone <em>mutes</em>. Everything. That's a logical assumption. </p><p>How can we satisfy the need to make our iPhones emit noise in some situations and to remain silent in others? Some have suggested introducing software controls so users can choose on a per-event basis. Others have envisioned an intelligent rules-based system based on GPS location (e.g. remain silent when at the coordinates of the Lincoln Center Plaza). I think both solutions are overly complicated.</p><p>Here's a simpler idea that would catch most user edge cases: leave the 'silent mode' functionality as is. When the phone is set to mute, the phone is silent except for events (alarms) that the user has explicitly set. Add, by default, one minute of vibration prior to sounding manually-set alarms when silent mode is engaged.</p><p>In <em>most</em> cases, users in concert halls and staff meetings will be physically alerted by their vibrating phone. They'll have time to pull the phone out and cancel the event before an audible alarm sounds. Sure, some users won't hear or feel the vibrating phone because it's buried in a jacket pocket hung behind a seat or stuffed in a purse. But most people will. They'll have time to react. </p>\n",

I had the metallic silver model (and still do). It sports a blazing fast 33 MHz CPU and 8MB of RAM. I've kept it over the years because it still works ... and because I think it's a great design. &nbsp;I especially loved the weight, shape, and feel of the little stylus. &nbsp;That stylus happens to be metallic.</p>\n<p>You see where I'm going here. Since the stylus is metal, all that I needed was some sort of conductive tip.</p>\n<p>Here's what I came up with. It works great as long as any part of my hand is touching the metal pen (which is hard not to do). It looks nice (I wouldn't say it's beautiful, but I think it looks better than most homemade styli). It's compact and easy to tote around. And here's the best part: the tip offers far more accuracy and draws a thinner line than commercial or homemade conductive styli that I've tried or seen demonstrated.</p>\n<p>Here's how I made it:</p>\n<div><span class=\"full-image-block ssNonEditable\"><span><img src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1256e4b0b2818fdccb1f/1323210030417/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1256e4b0b2818fdccb20/1323214809031/1000w\" alt=\"\" /></span><span class=\"thumbnail-caption\" style=\"width: 520px;\">Here are the primary ingredients. Heavy-duty aluminum foil, tape (I used electrical tape, but you could use duct tape), and a rubber foot that I found in my shop. </span></span></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p>About the rubber foot. This may be the hardest bit to find, but it's something you should be able to pick up at a hardware store (or, at least, you can find <a href=\"http://www.crowriver.com/cs/cs001.htm\">something similar</a>).&nbsp;I cut off part of the foot as seen in the photo above, then drilled a hole into the rubber that would tightly fit the metal stylus. Other materials will also work. I made an earlier model with a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/SeaTeak-Plugs-4-Inch-20-Bag/dp/B0042A3948/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323210940&amp;sr=1-1\">cheap wood plug</a> using the same method. It worked well, but isn't as flexible (meaning that you may have trouble with the wood cracking when you drill into it). Rubber works best.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"full-image-block ssNonEditable\"><span><img src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1256e4b0b2818fdccb21/1323210032023/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1256e4b0b2818fdccb22/1323210032081/1000w\" alt=\"\" /></span><span class=\"thumbnail-caption\" style=\"width: 520px;\">Now wrap the foil-wrapped rubber foot and stylus with a short piece of strong tape. Once you've done that, you're done. The blue shrink tubing you see here isn't really necessary. It's just for looks. I took a short segment of blue shrink tube, stretched it out with pliers so it would fit over the stylus, cover the tape, and partially cover the foil-wrapped foot. Then I applied heat to seal it all up.</span></span>&nbsp;<span class=\"full-image-block ssNonEditable\"><span><img src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1256e4b0b2818fdccb23/1323210033353/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1256e4b0b2818fdccb24/1323210033933/1000w\" alt=\"\" /></span><span class=\"thumbnail-caption\" style=\"width: 520px;\">And here is the completed stylus, ready for action.</span></span></p>\n<p>So that's all there is to it. It's a bit more involved than most of the DIY capacitive stylus tutorials you'll find on the web, but I think it's worth the effort. It works great. It looks nice. It's a great way to recycle a peice of old tech. I've been using it for a while and the aluminum is showing no signs of splitting. If it does split, it's a relatively simple matter to rip off the tip and make a new one. If you don't have an old Handspring Visor Edge in your closet and want to try this, would you believe that you can still <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B00005OCX3/ref=dp_olp_used?ie=UTF8&amp;condition=used\">buy a metal stylus</a>?&nbsp;</p>\n",

Only the on/off switch required soldering; I had to completely unsolder the switch to fit it through the hole in the wood. I used heat-shrinking plastic tubes to cover up the solder work. For the other wires,  I used plastic connector caps to join them back up.  I attached the components to the wood with screws and staples. It's hard to tell here, but I mounted the metal reflective shield from the old lamp to the wood surface behind the bulb. Last note: I had to cut all the wires when extracting them from the old lamp's plastic housing. The key thing to point out here is this: if you try something like this, be sure to mark the wires very carefully so you can remember how to reattach them.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"full-image-block ssNonEditable\"><span><img src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1256e4b0b2818fdccb1a/1316476419017/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1256e4b0b2818fdccb1b/1316476419038/1000w\" alt=\"\" /></span><span class=\"thumbnail-caption\" style=\"width: 520px;\">And here's a wider view so you can see the effect of the light reflecting off the wall behind my main monitor.</span></span>So that's it. The entire project took about five hours on a Sunday. I'm waiting for the glue to completely dry before applying a coat of polyurethane to the front.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The most challenging part was figuring out the design: I wanted to create a very simple and functional lamp using only scrap wood left behind from other projects. Aside from my time, the project didn't cost a dime.</p>\n<p>The tools I used to assemble the lamp included a miter saw (to cut all lengths and angles), a biscuit joiner (to join the two pine pieces and the feet to the base of the lamp), a drill (to create a hole for the on/off switch), a table saw (to cut a strip of oak for the top edge of the lamp), wood glue, and a sheet sander. &nbsp;For the electrical work, I used a soldering gun and some heat-shrink tubing, wire connectors, a wire cutter/stripper, and a few screws and staples.</p>\n<p>I think it looks better than the original. It certainly fits in better with my wooden desk than did the plastic lamp. I may have to go and break the other lamp now.</p>\n",

Now that I&rsquo;m nearing the two-month membership mark,&nbsp; I&rsquo;m familiar enough with the service to share some thoughts.&nbsp; I should start by noting that I&rsquo;m not the type of person who regularly signs up for paid services. I don&rsquo;t even subscribe to a cable TV package.</p>\n<p>So why do I think Spotify Premium is worth the price of admission?</p>\n<p>First and foremost, access to millions upon millions of tracks. While my musical tastes tend toward the eclectic and obscure, I&rsquo;ve been able to find most of what I was looking for.&nbsp; Second, the Premium service allows me to stream all the content I can reasonably consume, without ads, on my Mac or on my iPhone. Third, Premium serves up higher-quality audio. Fourth, I can cache songs for offline listening,&nbsp; useful for my daily train commute through farm country with spotty 3G service. And, finally, I can listen to most of my iTunes music on-the-go (provided I have a connection), as Spotify reads what I own and matches what it can with copies in the cloud.</p>\n<p>Spotify is a different sort of service from that of Pandora or Last.fm. It&rsquo;s better suited for people who know what they want, or at least are willing to take the time to explore. While there is an 'Artist Radio' function to stream similar artists, it&rsquo;s not a well-promoted feature.&nbsp; To be honest, I didn't even notice this feature for the first month and have never had the urge to use it. Instead, I tend to seek out a specific artist, then choose from a list of Spotify-suggested related artists. This often leads to uncharted territory and new artist discoveries. I like it because I feel that I am in direct control of the discovery process. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, all&nbsp; that I just described in the previous paragraph is available only on the desktop. The iPhone app is geared towards playing tracks already lined up in a playlist, with the exception of seeking out a specific artist, album, or track. In other words, I can search the Spotify database from the iPhone, but I have to know what I&rsquo;m looking for. There is no &lsquo;Artist Radio' streaming option and no &lsquo;Related Artists&rsquo; category on the mobile app. That&rsquo;s a shame.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, Spotify allows syncing of tracks from iTunes. The promise is that this will mostly alleviate the need to fire up the <em>other</em> music platform. I&rsquo;ve found this to be largely true. While the service only syncs non-DRM protected music from an iTunes library, that&rsquo;s not that big of a deal. I can always search out those missing files from Spotify&rsquo;s database, provided they&rsquo;re available.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I can also listen to most of my iTunes library on my iPhone or iPad without worrying about managing playlists due to limited storage space (provided I don&rsquo;t overdo it with offline caching). Spotify automatically matches the tunes in my iTunes library with online versions in Spotify&rsquo;s massive database. It&rsquo;s seamless.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, a fair number of my more obscure tracks and albums aren&rsquo;t available in Spotify&rsquo;s database. If I want these tracks to be available, I have to choose to sync them locally for offline listening.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve also noticed that some of my iTunes tracks appear on my phone with little link symbols. I had to look up what this meant. It indicates that (for some reason) the version of the song that I own isn&rsquo;t available to play in my country, so Spotify has substituted it for a playable version.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I admit I am mystified as to why some material isn&rsquo;t in the Spotify catalog, and why some tracks or albums are not available to U.S. customers. I'm sure it&rsquo;s based on agreements that Spotify has worked out with labels, but it can be frustrating because it can be so ... random. For instance, when I first started the service I downloaded &lsquo;<em>De Stilj</em>&rsquo; by the White Stripes. A day later, this album vanished from my playlist. That album is no longer available to stream in the U.S. However, all other White Stripes albums are available. In terms of explanation, all I get from Spotify is a notice that the tracks &lsquo;are not currently available in the United States.&rsquo; I can only imagine the convoluted paperwork that Spotify legal is juggling to keep this service going, so this isn&rsquo;t really a complaint. I'm impressed that they got it off the ground at all. I&rsquo;m just a bit miffed that I can&rsquo;t stream some albums and tracks that I&rsquo;d like to hear. Oddly, I've even come across many cases where all but one or two songs on a given album are available to stream. What's so special about those songs? Arg!</p>\n<p>Another example: The first disc of &lsquo;<em>Brewing Up With Billy Bragg</em>,&rsquo; circa 1984, is available if you search for it via the Spotify desktop app. However, the second disc in this two-disc set is unavailable in the U.S. How odd. Worse, if I search for this album via the iPhone app, the album doesn't appear at all. And a minor annoyance: that Billy Bragg album shows up as published in 2006. I&rsquo;m guessing that&rsquo;s a re-release date. I&rsquo;ve found this time and again with albums I&rsquo;ve sought out. The years don't match up with actual release dates. I&rsquo;ve also found that the same album often appears many times over in search results, but I can only listen to one of those albums in my country. I surmise that there are different licensed versions for different regions of the world. &nbsp;It would be nice to have the option within Spotify&rsquo;s preferences to hide the albums and tracks that I can&rsquo;t stream. It&rsquo;s the same thing to me as if those tracks and albums didn't exist at all, so I don't want to see them.</p>\n<p>Functionally speaking, the desktop and mobile Spotify apps work quite well, with a few caveats regarding playlists.&nbsp;The main problem I&rsquo;ve encountered is that the service doesn&rsquo;t import smart playlists from iTunes, which is how nearly all of my nearly 8,000 files in iTunes are organized. The remedy for this, of course, is to make new playlists. It's a simple task to copy and paste the contents of a smart playlist into a 'dumb' playlist within iTunes, and then import that. But that's annoying. And speaking of smart playlists, Spotify absolutely needs some sort of intelligent playlist functionality to sort through and categorize Spotify music. Dumb playlists just don&rsquo;t cut it. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a round-up of what I&rsquo;d like to see in future Spotify app releases:</p>\n<div></div>\n<ul>\n<li>More social sharing options. Right now, it&rsquo;s only Facebook. I have no urge to share anything with Facebook. Actually, I'm not sure I'm inclined to share my personal music library via any service, but I'm sure that many users would appreciate greater choice.</li>\n<li>Tooltips. The meaning of some of Spotify's color-coding and iconography isn't always obvious. Simple tooltips would help.</li>\n<li>It would be nice to have &lsquo;Related Artists&rsquo; and &lsquo;Artist Radio&rsquo; on the mobile app.</li>\n<li>I would appreciate the option to hide music that is not available for my country. I only want to see it if I can stream it.</li>\n<li>Smart playlists: the ability to import from iTunes, and to create within Spotify. Perhaps there may be patent/legal issues here to prevent some of this functionality, but surely Spotify could devise some sort of &lsquo;intelligent&rsquo; playlist capability. It&rsquo;s an all-you-can-eat music service, so we need better organization options.</li>\n<li>The user interface isn&rsquo;t always intuitive. For instance, on the desktop app, you can&rsquo;t get more information about an artist, or seek more albums/tracks from an artist, by selecting the artist name from within one of your playlists. You have to enter the name in the search box. When you&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;search for and select an artist, Spotify returns an interface with four tabs: an Overview, Biography, Related Artists, and Artist Radio. Maybe it's just me, but I didn&rsquo;t even notice the tabs at first. Oddly, the main window (the artist &lsquo;Overview&rsquo; tab) displays the beginning sentence or two of the artist biography and a short list of a few related artists. Since there's not much space here, only a fraction of the biography and related artists are visible, yet you can&rsquo;t select one of these items to access the full bio or related artist entries. You just get to see a tiny fraction of the content. There isn't even an option to scroll through the rest of the content. The only way to access this content is to select one of the tabs. Check out the screenshot below to see what I mean. Why not link the short blurbs on the 'Overview' page to the sub-tabs for Biography and Related Artists? </li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"full-image-block ssNonEditable\"><span><img src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1255e4b0b2818fdccb13/1316051508054/#img.jpg1000w\" alt=\"\" /></span><span class=\"thumbnail-caption\" style=\"width: 520px;\">The odd Spotify 'Overview' Pane</span></span>My overall experience? I love it. Prior to Spotify, I had hundreds of dollars of albums in my &lsquo;Wish List&rsquo; basket in iTunes. Now I&rsquo;m listening to all of those albums. Yes, I&rsquo;m paying $120 dollars a year for the privilege, but I&rsquo;m consuming far more music than I ever could afford to buy outright. My interest in discovering new artists is greater than it has been since I was in my 20s. Now when I learn of an interesting new artist or album, I don&rsquo;t have to read second-hand reviews or settle for short previews. And I don&rsquo;t have to add items to a &lsquo;Wish List.&rsquo; I just cue it up and experience it for myself. If I don&rsquo;t like it, I can just as easily remove it. It&rsquo;s a liberating experience.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, unlimited and instant access to millions of tracks means that it's easy to listen for one minute and then dump an album. Too easy. If I paid for an album, I would never do this. I'd listen to it over and over. I try to keep this habit with Spotify. Sure, I may still not like an album after a few listens. More often, though, I only begin to appreciate and enjoy an album after several weeks or months. Spotify's all-you-can-eat buffet can destroy this practiced patience if you let it.</p>\n<p>At any rate, I'm enjoying the service. Still, I am trying to keep my tracks well organized should I someday wish to cancel my subscription. What if fees get too steep? What if label agreements break down and the catalog drastically shrinks in size? My strategy is to carefully cultivate what I really like through playlists and by &lsquo;starring&rsquo; favorites. Should I need to leave and return to iTunes,&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have a good idea of which artist albums and tracks I want to buy and which I can do without.</p>\n<p>Of course, I hope that day won&rsquo;t arrive anytime soon. I'd love to see Spotify-like models appear for other content. I would consider signing up for similar services for audiobook, digital magazines, and ebook subscriptions.

				"title": "Captioning Web Video",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I'm no video expert. Yet I often find myself encoding, editing, and otherwise manipulating video for the web. Recently, I completed a video project that involved converting a DVD of a 40-minute presentation into a movie that could be viewed on a web page, as a whole or in chapters. The final product had to be <a href=\"http://webaim.org/techniques/captions/\">captioned</a>.</p>\n<p>Converting the DVD into video for the web was easy. I used <a href=\"http://handbrake.fr/\">Handbrake</a> to rip the DVD into <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_14\">MP4</a> format. Editing was equally easy. I used iMovie to add title screens and transitions, and to break the movie up into chapters. Adding the captioning, however, was tricky.</p>\n<p>Why bother with captioning? Here are some good reasons: so that those who are deaf or hard of hearing can enjoy the video, so the text is indexed by search engines, and to aid those for whom English is a second language. And here&rsquo;s another: the <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.3101:\">Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010</a>.</p>\n<p>If captioning is important, then why isn't it a mainstream practice? I'm not qualified to answer that question, but my guess is that it's in part due to the fact that captioning is time-consuming and difficult. For instance: with external captioning (where captions are contained in an external file and sync with the video), there are multiple formats and a lack of clear standards. And for embedded captioning (where captions are simply typed in an editor and then exported with the movie), it's just plain tedious work.</p>\n<p>For my recent video project, I considered three captioning options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Embed the captions</strong>. The first option is to place the captions directly into the movie itself using a tool such as Final Cut Pro,&nbsp; iMovie, or&nbsp; Adobe Premiere.&nbsp; I have Final Cut Pro, but I tend to use iMovie since most of the video work I do is short and simple. It&rsquo;s the easiest tool for the job and the results look good. Here&rsquo;s the thing about iMovie: while there are dozens of title/text effect options, none are designed for captioning (which is surprising given Apple's robust accessability options for the OS). Despite this shortcoming, I&rsquo;ve discovered that I can 'fake' captions by adding lower thirds to each segment of video. Making a default lower third overlay in iMovie into something that resembles a caption is a matter of changing font sizes. You can see an example of this in a recent <a href=\"http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/podcast/supp_july11.html#mw78\">video podcast</a> I produced.&nbsp;This works, but it isn't a practical solution for a long movie. In truth, it's really not an ideal solution for any length movie because the captions are permanently embedded in the video. Screen readers and search engines can't see this text.&nbsp;People can&rsquo;t choose to turn the captions on/off. So I didn't choose this option for my project.</li>\n<li><strong>Dump the text on the page</strong>. A second option is to dump the captioning for a video on a page, underneath the video as HTML text. This may technically meets accessibility requirements, but it&rsquo;s a lousy solution. The text is unassociated with the video. One can read the text or watch the video. It's not feasible to do both at the same time. Nix.</li>\n<li><strong>Create an external caption file</strong>. This last choice is the best solution: create an external caption file that will appear in sync with the video. Captioning is then matched up with the video, it's readable by screen readers, and it's good for search engines. It can also be turned on or off at the user's discretion.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So how do you create and deploy and external caption file? If you simply wish to place a video on Youtube, it's easy. Once you upload your video to the free service, Youtube offers free auto-generated <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?answer=100077\">machine transcription</a>. While you'll find that video speech-to-text accuracy is hit-and-miss (more <em>miss</em> in my experience), the important part is that Google generates&nbsp; time codes that precisely match the the audio in the video. So once you download the caption file from Youtube, it's a simply a matter of manually correcting the text so that what appears in the caption will match what is actually being said in the video.</p>\n<p>If you don't want to (or can't because of workplace <a href=\"http://www.usa.gov/webcontent/reqs_bestpractices/laws_regs/index.shtml\">policy</a>) solely use Youtube to present your video, it's still a very useful tool. How? If you are embedding captions in a video using an editor such as iMovie, YouTube will do half of the work for you by delivering a fair approximation of a transcript. If you want to use an external caption file elsewhere with a different video player, you can still use this Google-generated file. You just need to convert it into the right format.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the process I used to generate a caption file for my video project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I began by uploading the video to my YouTube channel.</li>\n<li>I then requested that YouTube auto-generate a Subviewer caption file for this movie (Be patient. It may take hours to get this file back from Google because you'll be in a queue with tons of other people).</li>\n<li>I then downloaded this file and opened it up in text editor.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The next step is tedious, but necessary: cleaning up the machine-generated text. I opened my movie in a QuickTime player window and, as it played, edited my caption text to correct errors and typos. It's not too bad if you toogle between a text editor and QuickTime using Cmd-Tab.</li>\n<li>Once I had my cleaned-up Subviewer text file, I copied and pasted it it into a free online  converter to generate into the appropriate format. In my case, I generated a DFXP file for use with a Flash player. Here are three  conversion tool options: <br />\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.3playmedia.com/resources/caption-format-converter/\">3PlayMedia Caption Format Converter</a>. This converter lets you convert from SRT or from SBV to&nbsp; DFXP, SMI or SAMI (Windows Media),  CPT.XML (Flash Captionate XML), QT (Quicktime), and STL (Spruce Subtitle  File).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://subtitle-horse.com/\">Subtitle Horse</a>. A free online caption editor. Exports DFXP, SRT, and Adobe Encore files.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wac.osu.edu/examples/youtube-player-controls/yt-cap-convert/\">Subviewer to DFXP</a>. This free online tool from Ohio State University converts a YouTube .SBV file into DFXP, Subrip, or QT (QuickTime caption) files. I used this tool for my project.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What&rsquo;s the appropriate format?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>YouTube: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubViewer\">Subviewer</a> (.SBV)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>iTunes, iOS: Scenarist Closed Caption (.SCC)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Flash: <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/\">DFXP</a>, Timed Text Markup Language, the W3C recommendation. These are plain ol&rsquo; XML files.&nbsp; You could also use the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip\">SubRip</a> (.SRT) file format for Flash.</li>\n<li>HTML5:&nbsp; See this <a href=\"http://webaim.org/blog/future-web-accessibility-html5-video/\">post</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're not using a hosted service like YouTube or Vimeo (which, incidentally, does not support external captions), you'll of course have to decide how to present the video on your site. There are many options. You can roll your own <a href=\"http://layersmagazine.com/closed-captioned-video-in-flash.html\">player</a> with external captions using Adobe  Flash. You can use off-the-shelf players that support captioning such as  <a href=\"http://flowplayer.org/\">Flowplayer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.longtailvideo.com/players\">JW Player</a> &mdash; these two commercial products offer very easy setup and they offer HTML5  video players with Flash fallback. Another option: you might try HTML5 with experimental  captioning support (note that <a href=\"http://www.deafmac.org/blog/2010/safari-5-now-available-shows-captions-in-html5-video/\">Safari 5 now supports captioning</a> with the HTML5 video tag). As I said, there are options. The video player discussion is beyond  the scope of this post (and I  don&rsquo;t want to go down the HTML5 vs. Flash rabbit hole!).</p>\n<p>My main goal here is to point out that Google's machine transcription is good for more than just hosting a captioned video on Youtube. It's trivial to convert this caption file into a variety of formats. The key point is that you don't have to manually add time codes for your video. This critical step is done for you.</p>\n<p>Yet even with this handy Google tool, generating caption files (and getting them to work with video players) remains an unwieldy task. We clearly need better tools and standards to help bring video captioning into the mainstream.</p>\n<p>P.S. While researching this post, I came across two low-cost tools that look like solid options to create iOS and iTunes movies with captions. Both are from a company called <a href=\"http://www.bitfield.se\">bitfield</a>. The first is called <a href=\"http://www.bitfield.se/submerge/\">Submerge</a>. This tool makes it very easy to embed (hard-code) subtitles in a movie and will import all the popular external captioning formats. The second is called <a href=\"http://www.bitfield.se/isubtitle/\">iSubtitle</a>. This tool will &lsquo;soft-code&rsquo; subtitle tracks so you can add multiple files (languages) and easily add metadata to your movie.</p>\n",

But the lack of ability to draw on pages, &nbsp;search text, highlight passages, or define words seems like a missed opportunity to harness the platform.</p>\n<p>Since many of these texts have already been digitized, wouldn't it be fantastic to offer users the ability to switch (or overlay, or display side-by-side) a scanned original page in a book and its corresponding digitized text? Then we could have the best of both worlds. At a minimum, we need a way to take some notes and add multiple bookmarks. That said, this is a great app for the book junkie. It's free for now.</p>\n",

I used it to prep this image collage. I've been using Photoshop since the 1996, so this is a significant change.</p>\n<p>Will it replace Photoshop? Maybe, someday. I'd like to be able to migrate away from Adobe, mainly because the software updates are expensive; I, a relative power user, really don't need many of Photoshop's capabilities; I find I need the other Adobe tools in the Creative Suite (web edition) less and less; I like supporting indie developers.</p>\n<p>The problem is that my Photoshop workflow has evolved over many years. I can whip out images quite fast with the tool. Acorn appears to offer many of the tools I need (if not most, to be honest), but learning a new app and getting that speed back is going to take some time.</p>\n<p>Learning to use Acorn efficiently feels akin to the time, years ago, when I learned to type in Dvorak instead over Qwerty. The above image would take me a minute to create in Photoshop. It took me 15 minutes in Acorn. But that's to be expected.</p>\n<p>So far, it's doing the job well ... and it's fast, fast, fast. I also appreciate many of the little touches in Acorn that make it pleasant to use (e.g., when I add a guide, I'm shown the pixel measurement in a little bubble window as I scroll the guide into place). And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that it supports all of my Dvorak-Qwerty keyboard shortcuts, which is something that I can't say for my version of Photoshop (CS3). So I'm sticking with it as my primary editor to see if I can make the switch. Even if it doesn't meet all my needs, I still have Photoshop CS3 to fall back on if I need more advanced features. My hope is that I won't need to upgrade to the newest CS version of Photoshop. Ever.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I finally broke down and bought an Apple Magic Mouse a couple of weeks back to replace an aging Logitech MX Revolution. I'm happy with my new input device, but I suspect it will be the last Apple mouse I ever buy. That's because I'm convinced that this is Apple's final mouse.</p>\n<p>When I first started using it, I thought of the mouse as a hybrid device that cleverly combines old and new input ideas. After using it for a while, I've started to think about it as a transitional device. The Magic Mouse isn't about the mouse at all. It's all about the Multi-Touch surface.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My guess is that Apple will soon proclaim the mouse dead and drop it from their product line. Only the Magic Trackpad will remain for desktop computers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Is the Magic Trackpad a superior input device? Based on my experience using the Trackpad on my Macbook Pro, I'd say it's better for most tasks but not as good for tasks that require fine control. The Multi-Touch, finger-driven interface is great, but it would be even better to have a large Trackpad that could transform into a Wacom-style pen tablet device. Perhaps a gesture could toggle modes. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of course, even touch surfaces may someday be obviated by eye- and voice-controlled desktop computing. I can see how such future tech might work well for routine tasks, but I wager we'd still need some sort of physical input device for precision work (e.g., detailed selections, drawing). I bet that device will look a lot more like a Trackpad than a mouse. It could also look like an iPad running a Trackpad app.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Author Charles J. Shields has <a href=\"http://writingkurtvonnegut.com/\">started a blog</a> about writing '<em>And So it Goes</em>,' a Kurt Vonnegut biography due out this November. What better name could a Vonnegut biography have, really?&nbsp;I look forward to reading it. I'm always struck by how Vonnegut talked in the same fashion as he wrote. From Shields' post about his first meeting with the author:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He walks rather slowly, loping along, and stoop-shouldered too from writing for nearly sixty years. During the walk, we made small talk. Nothing memorable. I had a strange feeling of not being able to get much of a purchase on the conversation. Vonnegut doesn&rsquo;t converse with you as much as make pronouncements. Apropos of nothing, he mentioned that only one-third of New York City public school students graduate. &ldquo;Most of them who drop out are black,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Slavery was not such a good idea. My hero, Voltaire,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;speculated in the slave trade.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When we reached the restaurant, the owner, a tall, slim blonde man in his late thirties opened the door and beamed. No one else was there.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Welcome on a cold and rainy day,&rdquo; he said, in a Dutch-accented voice.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is my biographer,&rdquo; Vonnegut said, indicating me.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s about time,&rdquo; said the restaurateur happily.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Kurt replied with a shrug. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vonnegut died months after they met. Shields plans to post a new entry each Saturday chronicling his five-year journey to write the biography.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I've read and own nearly all of Vonnegut's books. Slaughterhouse Five is certainly great, but my all-time favorite is surely Cat's Cradle. If you're a fan, do yourself a favor and get a copy of '<a href=\"http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_3?asin=B002V1LL1S&amp;qid=1298981706&amp;sr=1-3\">Kurt Vonnegut's Audio Collection</a>.' It includes Slaughterhouse, Cat's Cradle, Breakfast of Champions , and short stories from Welcome to the Monkey House, all read by Kurt Vonnegut. Even if you don't like audio, you owe it to yourself to hear Vonnegut reading his own works.</p>\n",

It includes videos on casting; a great fly database (with useful info such as where and when to use a fly, how to fish it, descriptions, and images), knot-tying instructions (with animations, videos, and written instructions; with knots filed by name or categorized by knots for particular tasks), fishing reports for popular areas by state, podcasts, and a glossary. And you can also shop the Orvis online store, if you're so inclined. I was a bit hesitant to put my faith in a relatively expensive app from a retailer, but it's solid.</p>\n<p>Before you write this app off as too costly, consider this: Orvis is now offering a $10 coupon for those who buy the app to use in their online and retail stores. And right now, they're offering a special promotion for 20 of their most popular flies for $9.95 with free shipping (limit one per household). After applying the coupon code (accounting for taxes), you can get this solid set of flies, nymphs, and streamers for .60 cents. It's a steal, even if you already have a lot of flies. And they accept PayPal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm sensitive to the fact that this may sound like I'm a pitch man for Orvis, but this really is a good deal. And the app is a handy reference and teaching aid.</p>\n<p>Caveat: I shouldn't get too excited about this offer yet. I'm still awaiting my $10 coupon code. According to Orvis, I should receive it by e-mail within 48 hours. In the off-chance that the fly bundle deal expires before then, I'm not too concerned. I need some tippet and a few other odds and ends.</p>\n<p>You could make the argument that Orvis should give the app away in hopes of selling their wares through mobile devices. For my part, I really don't think I'll be buying anything from Orvis via my iPhone. As I've said, I'm planning to use this app as a mobile reference and instructional tool. I hesitated before I hit the 'purchase' button in iTunes, but then I considered the fact that I've plunked down far more than $15 for various fly fishing books. I've never been inclined to bring books with me when I go fishing, but I always have my iPhone. And unlike a book, this app includes videos, animations, and podcasts. And Orvis says the app will continue to be updated.<strong>*&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>As for price of admission, I think it's also worth noting that the audience for such a specialized app is sure to be small, so I don't think it's unreasonable to charge $15 to get access to all of this content at one's fingertips. &nbsp;I'll update this post once (if) I successfully land the fly bundle.</p>\n<p><em><strong>*</strong>&nbsp;Orvis also says that&nbsp;<em>they're going to deliver in-app purchase modules in the future. I</em>t'll be interesting to see how may free updates are delivered, compared to paid upgrades. Would I pay for new training modules? Maybe. It would certainly be a lot cheaper than attending a fly fishing class or school.</em></p>\n",

This small collection led me on a small tour-de-link this evening that began with the offerings of <a href=\"http://library.wellcome.ac.uk/\">The Wellcome Library</a>, turned to&nbsp;the ever-absorbing&nbsp;<a href=\"http://tolweb.org/tree/phylogeny.html\">Tree of Life</a>&nbsp;Web project, and ended with thoughts about IBM's <a href=\"http://www-943.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/\">Watson</a>.</p>\n<p>How did I get there? I'm not sure. I do know, though, that I found myself looking up the <a href=\"http://www.k-web.org/public_html/home.htm\">James Burke Knowledge Web</a>&nbsp;somewhere along the way&mdash;a project that aims to serve as a counterpoint to specialized, stove-piped knowledge by connecting overlapping bits of history, technology, science, and culture. I used to read Burke's 'Connections' column in Scientific American and recall, long ago, watching episodes of the TV series. I've loosely followed Burke's web project for many years, hoping it would take off. Unfortunately, the site looks much the same now as it did when I last checked several years ago.&nbsp;I think it's long been surpassed (or, rather, bypassed) by other collaborative projects, namely Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>Yet I don't think today's offerings on the Web come anywhere close to meeting the intent of the Burke project. The nearest example I can think of that emphasizes discovery across disciplines and through history is the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thewikigame.com/\">Wikipedia Game</a>, although it's only a shadow of the bigger idea.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While searching for the rules of the Wikipedia Game, I inadvertently came across a reference to something altogether new to me, called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(mind_game)\">The Game</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The objective is to avoid thinking about The Game itself. Thinking about The Game constitutes a loss, which, according to the rules of The Game, must be announced each time it occurs. It is impossible to win The Game; players can only attempt to avoid losing for as long as they possibly can.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Funny stuff. This obscurity reminded me of one of the first philosophy books I ever read: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games\">Finite and Infinite Games</a> by James P. Carse. It's an abstract book that I find myself revisiting over the years, as I've found that it means different things to me as I grow older. It's what you might call a long-term reading experience, in much the same way that Sun Tzu's Art of War isn't something you really <em>read</em>. The content is best sampled, sparingly.</p>\n<p>Of course I had to look up the Carse book in Wikipedia, too.&nbsp;I was delighted to find a reference there to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now\">Clock of the Long Now</a>, which is a project to create a 10,000 year clock. This interesting idea comes from the <a href=\"http://longnow.org/\">Long Now Foundation</a>&mdash;another site which I frequent&mdash;dedicated to long-term thinking.&nbsp;If there's one thing we humans need to do more often, it's surely long-term thinking.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What do finite and infinite games have to do with long-term thought? I'll quote what seems to be the most-often quoted part of Carse's slim book (from the first chapter):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are at least two kinds of games. One could be called finite, the other infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Long Now is about playing the infinite game. What could help us become better players? At least one answer is to improve our ability to connect the dots between our history, technology, science, and culture.</p>\n<p>I wound up my evening Web surf with a really <a href=\"http://thebrowser.com/interviews/stephen-baker-on-watson?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Fivebooks+%28FiveBooks%29\">interesting post</a> about IBM's Watson performance on the Jeopardy! game show. Watson certainly put in an impressive performance, demonstrating how computing power is starting to make inroads into the realm of knowledge and language. &nbsp;Certainly, it showed great promise at answering questions based on ambiguous, misleading, and subtle clues (with notable exceptions). Perhaps we should introduce Watson to the Wikipedia Game. Then we could see how it does at assembling Burke's Knowledge Web. I bet Watson could turn up some interesting connections.</p>\n",

While Audition for Mac remains in Beta, anyone can download it for free to take it for a spin. It's worth a look if you're interested in advanced audio editing.</p>\n\n<p>I'm planning to use it to produce the next episode of my <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/noaas-national-ocean-service/id304735817\">podcast</a> to see how it stacks up to Apple's Soundtrack Pro. In preliminary tests editing some audio files and piecing together a multitrack project, it seems to offer all of the tools and capabilities of the Apple audio editing program (at least for my needs).</p>\n\n<p>I'm interested in Audition as an eventual replacement for Soundtrack Pro. As much as I like Soundtrack Pro, I don't like the fact that I can only get it as part of the Final Cut Studio suite. I don't really use the other Final Cut tools*, so I'm loathe to upgrade to the most-recent version of the Apple suite just to use the audio editing application. A bit of backstory: I own the first version of Final Cut Studio, which I purchased at a steep discount thanks to an Apple promotion for people who previously owned one of the stand-alone apps that make up the Suite.</p>\n\n<p>This is not to say that I want to purchase the stand-alone version of Adobe Audition. That would likely cost more than the upgrade price for Final Cut Studio. Rather, I'm anticipating that I might pick it up as part of a suite when Adobe comes out with CS6, as I'm still using CS3.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Here's the thing, though. Both Audition and Soundtrack Pro offer much more power than I really need.</p>\n\n<p>However, these pro-level tools allow me to do things with audio that I just can't do with other tools. I've tried to make GarageBand work, but it's just too limited. I've tried <a href=\"http://audacity.sourceforge.net/\">Audacity</a>, too, but it's just too hard to use when juggling six or seven tracks and scores of clips. &nbsp;I keep going back to Soundtrack Pro.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What I'd really love to see is an audio application from Apple that's akin to Final Cut Express. I want Soundtrack Express. It would offer less than Soundtrack Pro, but more than GarageBand. What do you say, Apple?</p>\n\n<p><em>* I would gladly upgrade my copy of Final Cut Studio if the next version rolls in new capabilities to publish content for iOS devices.</em></p>\n",

The author outlines five data-driven trends to look for this year. His last point struck me as particularly prescient: \"You'll be sick of hearing about data (if you're not already).\"</p>\n<p>Right on. It's only February, and I'm already feeling it.  I can't seem to escape the deluge of articles about data. How we acquire it. How we store it. How we separate the wheat from the chaff. This week in particular sticks out.</p>\n<h2><em>Science</em> special: Dealing With Data</h2>\n<p>The Feb. 11 issue of the journal Science includes a <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/data/\">special issue</a> devoted to the challenges and opportunities of data collection, curation, and access. The entire collection of perspective articles are available online for free (registration required). From the <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6018/692.short\">introduction</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\"We have recently passed the point where more data is being collected than we can physically store. This storage gap will widen rapidly in data-intensive fields. Thus, decisions will be needed on which data to archive and which to discard. A separate problem is how to access and use these data. Many data sets are becoming too large to download. Even fields with well-established data archives, such as genomics, are facing new and growing challenges in data volume and management. And even where accessible, much data in many fields is too poorly organized to enable it to be efficiently used.\"</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"full-image-float-right ssNonEditable\"><span><a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/data/\"><img src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1236e4b0b2818fdccaec/1297531369547/#img.jpg.com/news/2011-02-world-scientists-total-technological-capacity.html\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://huffduffer.com/chezfugu/34988\">here</a>.

Put another way, if a single star is a bit of information, that's a galaxy of information for every person in the world. That's 315 times the number of grains of sand in the world. But it's still less than one percent of the information that is stored in all the DNA molecules of a human being.</li>\n<li>In 2007, humankind successfully sent 1.9 zettabytes of information through broadcast technology such as televisions and GPS. That's equivalent to every person in the world reading 174 newspapers every day.</li>\n<li>On two-way communications technology, such as cell phones, humankind shared 65 exabytes of information through telecommunications in 2007, the equivalent of every person in the world communicating the contents of six newspapers every day.</li>\n</blockquote>\n</ul>\n<h2>Simulating Twitter, The Locker Project</h2>\n<p>But this wasn't the only fascinating data-centric news this week. <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/26355/?ref=rss\">MIT's Technology Review</a> reports that <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0699\">researchers in Spain</a> have constructed a simulated network called SONG (Social Network Write Generator) that can forecast Tweet behavior. Why would one want to do this?</p>\n<blockquote>Many groups are likely to be interested in using a virtual Twitterverse. Erramilli and co say it can be used to analyse the capacity of parts of a network and to benchmark its performance. But it's the ability to forecast tweeting activity and the effect of things like flash mobbing that is likely to generate the most interest.</blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/02/singly-locker-project-telehash.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+oreilly%2Fradar%2Fatom+%28O%27Reilly+Radar%29\">O'Reilly Radar blog reports</a> this week of a new company called <a href=\"http://sing.ly/\">Singly</a> that aims to popularize the open source <a href=\"https://github.com/quartzjer/Locker#readme\">Locker Project</a>, which will employ a new protocol called <a href=\"http://www.telehash.org/about.html\">TeleHash</a>. It took me a while to wrap my head around this. Essentially, it's about harnessing and sharing data in new, more personalized ways. Here's an excerpt from <a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/creator_of_instant_messaging_protocol_to_launch_ap.php\">a recent post on ReadWriteWeb</a> that helped:</p>\n<blockquote>The open source service will capture what's called exhaust data from users' activities around the web and offline via sensors, put it firmly in their own possession and then allow them to run local apps that are built to leverage their data.</blockquote>\n<p>Many prognosticators suggest that this will be the Next Big Thing for apps and online services. Web 3.0, in other words, will be all about me. It's about delivering a highly-personalized data set that will draw together my online and (increasingly) offline activity. It'll be sort of like a data journal (or a locker). And by combining my data with other data sets, I'll presumably be able to find hidden patterns, correlations, and context that relate to my life in a very personal way.</p>\n<p>As I understand it, the TeleHash protocol will permit the decentralized P2P sharing and searching for data across the network. It's about me connecting with you&mdash;just as we do in today's social enivironment&mdash; but in a much more targeted and sophisticated way. While I'm sure I haven't grasped all of the nuances of this project, it sounds promising.</p>\n<h2>IBM's Watson on Jeopardy!</h2>\n<p><span class=\"full-image-float-right ssNonEditable\"><span><a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/what-is-watson/index.html\"><img src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1236e4b0b2818fdccaed/1297531943003/#img.jpg.org/wgbh/nova/tech/smartest-machine-on-earth.html\">Smartest Machine on Earth</a>. Apt to my theme, it's about the big three-day contest next week on Jeopardy that pits two of the show's best-ever human contestants against IBM's Watson. If you're unable to watch Jeopardy next week, Ph.D. students who worked on the Watson project are going to <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/smartest-machine-on-earth.html\">live-blog</a> the contest as it airs.</p>\n<p>Will the machine win? It's going to be fun to watch. Even if Watson doesn't win, it's amazing that a machine exists that can (quickly) answer obtuse Jeopardyesque questions. Talk about harnessing data. By the way, be sure to check out <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/what-is-watson/index.html\">IBM's Watson website</a>. They've done a good job with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sending Data Offworld</h2>\n<p>So ... there are many interesting efforts going on to better process, use and understand the data we're collectively generating on planet Earth. But what about transmitting data off the planet? Yes, I'm talking about the search for extraterrestrial life. There's a preprint of a <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1938\">new study out this week</a> about this pursuit, too.</p>\n<p>It's a fascinating&mdash;and refreshingly readable&mdash;paper about METI. That's Messaging to Extraterrestrial Intelligence. The paper sums of the debate encircling how, and if, we should try to send transmissions into the void. It suggests that current attempts at transmissions are probably too feeble to matter, and suggests future laser and microwave systems may be more viable. The authors also advocate a moratorium on future METI transmissions until an international body addresses the risks associated with attempts to contact ET life.</p>\n<p>Here's one excerpt that struck me:</p>\n<blockquote>In 2000, the International Academy of Astronautics sent a proposal to the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space entitled \"Declaration of Principles for Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence&rdquo;, also known as the First Protocol (Billingham and Heyns 1999). The proposal was received without objection. Principle 8 reads, in part \"No response to a signal or other evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence should be sent until appropriate international consultations have taken place\". No one seems opposed to having international consultations about transmitting after we detect them by standard SETI. Assuming this to be the case, it is surely even more important to have the consultations about transmitting before we detect them when we don't even have their signal in hand.</blockquote>\n<p>Good point.</p>\n",

'<em>Why not try something else out?</em>,' I thought. It's not that I don't like Simplenote. It's great. But I've never tried anything else beyond Apple's paltry notes and the overpowered Evernote. Surely there are other worthy contendors out there.</p>\n<p>What began as a simple search for an alternative snowballed into a larger project. I began by mulling over what is important to me when it comes to the note-taking (and note-retrieval) process. Ubiquity, certainly. I want my notes to be available anywhere, on any device. I want to be confident that the changes I've made to a note on my iPhone or on my Mac at work will sync back to my Mac at home. Simplicity, too. For all the praises of Evernote, I just can't use it without wincing. It's just so ... heavy. I need something light, like Simplenote.</p>\n<p>Then there's format.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a rule, I try to keep all of my important notes in plain text, stored in individual files. One reason for this is longevity. This is the one format that will always be accessible. Another reason is utility. Plain text may be cut and paste into just about any application. The final reason is portability. I store all of my important plain text documents (all of my documents, really) outside of databases, in individual files accessable through the Finder. File sizes are tiny, and I can move these files around and modify them with ease. So I want a tool that specializes in plain text.</p>\n<p>What else? I also quite liked that I could email myself notes with the Simplenote premium service. I'd like to keep that ability. And I&nbsp;want to keep my notes synced with a lightweight desktop client. With Simplenote, I use the free Notational Velocity (actually, I'm using <a href=\"http://brettterpstra.com/code/notational-velocity-alt/\">nvALT</a>,&nbsp;a fork of NV with some extra capabilities). I'd like to keep using that. And I'd like to add one new thing that I've never tried: I want my notes to sync with my desktop file organizer, <a href=\"http://c-command.com/eaglefiler/\">EagleFiler</a>.</p>\n<p>With all of these criteria in mind, two alternatives stuck out: <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/writeroom/id288751446?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4\">WriteRoom</a>&nbsp;($5) and <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plaintext-dropbox-text-editing/id391254385?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4\">PlainText</a>&nbsp;(free), both by <a href=\"http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/\">Hog Bay Software</a>. I tried both tools and settled on WriteRoom (even though PlainText meets most of my needs and looks great, it has no search capability. That's a deal-breaker).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What follows is my solution for the syncing bit. This solution allows me to store all of my notes in one folder on my Mac. If I change a plain text file within EagleFiler, within nvALT, on my iPhone, or by directly editing one of my files via the Finder, the changes will be synced across-the-board.</p>\n<p>You may wonder why I want my notes in both Notational Velocity and in EagleFiler. The answer is that it's more convenient and flexible. On the Mac, Notational Velocity is a speedy way to get to a note to modify it, or to quickly add or delete a note. EagleFiler (EF) is where all of my important documents reside, so I'm often using it (why switch to another program if I don't have to?). Added to this, EF is where&nbsp;I typically add metadata to my notes (flags, tags, etc.). And since all of my documents are in EagleFiler, I can perform more complex searches to easily locate, say, all notes and PDFs and other documents that contain certain keywords. Also, it's easier to move bits of text from my notes to other documents within EagleFiler. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here's how I set up syncing using WriteRoom, although a similar scheme works with slight modifications for Simplenote and PlainText. I'll get into some of those differences at the end.</p>\n<p><strong>Using WriteRoom</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first step is to buy the iOS version of <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/writeroom/id288751446?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4\">WriteRoom</a>. Log in to WriteRoom using an existing Google ID (you can also chose to <a href=\"http://knol.google.com/k/host-your-own-simpletext-ws-site-with-apps-engine#\">host your own sync service</a>) and select 'Sync Automatically' from the apps Settings menu. Then head to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.simpletext.ws/\">simpletext.ws</a> and log in, using the same Google ID. You can now sync your notes to this subscription-free online service.</li>\n<li>Now you&rsquo;ll need to get the free <a href=\"http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/simpletext\">SimpleText</a> Mac client from&nbsp;Hog Bay Software&nbsp;and install that. This tiny app runs in the menubar. When you first run it, it creates a new folder in your Home folder called 'SimpleText.' Open the SimpleText app Preferences and choose to 'Start on Login' and 'Automatically Sync When Local Files Change.' Your text notes will now sync to the newly-created 'SimpleText' folder. Each note will be stored as an individual file. </li>\n<li>Next, you need to create a folder within EagleFiler. I called mine 'Sync.' Once created, you need to download and install a free app called '<a href=\"http://wiki.dropbox.com/DropboxAddons/MacDropAny\">MacDropAny</a>.' This simple tool allows you to sync any folder on your Mac using <a href=\"http://db.tt/6rSP2OD\">Dropbox</a>&nbsp;(Note: you need to be a Dropbox user to use MacDropAny). &nbsp;When you run MacDropAny, you'll be asked to select a source and destination folder. The destination folder is that which you've just created within EagleFiler (you'll have to find it via the Finder). The Source is your 'SimpleText' folder where your notes are held. </li>\n<li>Now here's where you'll notice a problem. MacDropAny won't allow you to select an existing folder as your 'Source.' How do you get around this? Here's what I did. I temporarily copied my existing text files residing in the 'SimpleText' folder, then deleted that folder (you could also just move the folder to your desktop). Then I ran MacDropAny, choosing to create a folder called 'SimpleText' as my Source folder. After I did that, I copied back my notes (text files) to the 'SimpleText' folder. I know, it's a bit clumsy ... but it works.</li>\n<li>Next, head to Notational Velocity (or nvALT) Preferences and choose the 'Storage' tab. Choose to 'Store and read notes on disk as Plain Text Files.' &nbsp;Then you need to choose the folder to store the files. &nbsp;This is where you point to (you guessed it) the 'SimpleText' folder where all of your notes reside.</li>\n<li>Now test it out. Add some text to a file on your iPhone. The changes should appear within EagleFiler and within Notational Velocity. Change some text in EagleFiler or Notational Velocity. The changes should appear back on your iPhone.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>EagleFiler Caveats</h3>\n<p>There are a few caveats about using EagleFiler. You're not really supposed to add files directly to file structure within Finder, but that's what I'm doing here. It works well enough, but it takes a little extra effort to keep it running smoothly.</p>\n<p>EagleFiler uses a database to store metadata. An important part of that is monitoring any changes to files held within the app. If you delete a file on your iPhone, directly from the SimpleText folder, or from Notational Velocity, EagleFiler doesn't know what happend to that file. A similar thing happens if you change a file outside of EagleFiler, as the app monitors each files <a href=\"http://c-command.com/eaglefiler/manual-ah/update-checksum\">checksum</a> to keep track of changes&mdash;I'm guessing many people don't even use this checksum feature, but it's there to ensure the integrity of your files.</p>\n<p>So. Changing text in a note or adding new notes outside of EagleFiler isn't a big deal. You won't see any error messages unless you use checksum. If you do use checksum, you need to periodically update the checksums for the files you've changed (you're basically telling EagleFiler that the file is OK and that you've changed it from outside of the program).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For files deleted outside of EF, you'll notice that EagleFiler retains the deleted file, but the contents of the file within EagleFiler now have no content. That's because the file isn't there anymore. To fix this, periodically run 'Scan for New Files' from the EagleFiler 'File' menu (Shift-Apple-R). EF will then show you all the files that cannot be found (as they've been deleted) so you can go in and clean them up from the list within the app. Once you delete them from the EF file structure, empty the trash.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A few final notes about EagleFiler. The app creates new Rich Text Format documents by default. If you want to move an existing file that is in RTF to your EagleFiler sync folder, you'll first need to convert it to plain text. There's a handy <a href=\"http://c-command.com/scripts/eaglefiler/convert-rich-text-to-plain-text\">script</a> to do that. If you want to create a new note in your EF synced folder, hold down the 'Option' key while choosing the 'New RTF' button from the menu bar, and a new plain text file will instead be created (there is no 'New Plain Text' button option).&nbsp;I should also mention that the metadata you add to a note in EagleFiler stays (is only visible) in EagleFiler. Those tags, flags, etc., do not transfer to your externally-stored notes. However, this metadata does persist in EagleFiler, even if you modify a note outside of the program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While syncing plain text files to EagleFiler may sound difficult to maintain, it's really not bad. I think it's worth it. (I'm now waiting for the developer or other EF users to tell me that this is a terrible idea!)</p>\n<h3>Syncing with Simplenote, PlainText</h3>\n<p>You can use a similar process to sync files using the <a href=\"http://simplenoteapp.com/\">Simplenote</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/plaintext\">PlainText</a> iOS apps. I tried them both out and the syncing worked just as well. Actually, these other apps were a bit easier to set up.</p>\n<p>For <strong>PlainText</strong>, the main difference is that this app stores your notes using Dropbox (in a folder called 'PlainText).' Since the syncing is via Dropbox, you won't need the SimpleText Mac client. Note, though, that you also won't get the simpletext.ws online syncing.</p>\n<p>For <strong>Simplenote</strong>, Notational Velocity includes built-in syncing support so it's a bit, um, simpler. And while Simplenote does not store notes in individual text files, you can accomplish the same thing via Notational Velocity. You just need to head to Preferences within NV and choose to store your notes as files on your local disk as plain text files. You can choose any folder you like. However, if you want to go the extra step of syncing with EagleFiler, you'll need to be a Dropbox user so you can take advantage of <a href=\"http://wiki.dropbox.com/DropboxAddons/MacDropAny\">MacDropAny</a>. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Emailing plain text messages</h3>\n<p>The last point to talk about is how to add the ability to send messages from your email client to your notes folder.</p>\n<p>With a Simplenote subscription, it's a straightforward task since this service provides you with an email address. There's nothing more to do.</p>\n<p>With WriteRoom and PlainText, you need to bring in a couple of other tools. First, set up a free (donationware) service called, appropriately, <a href=\"http://www.dropbox.com/apps/833/send-to-dropbox\">Send to Dropbox</a>. This service establishes a folder within your Dropbox called 'Attachments' and provides you with an email address to send your messages to. Note that this third-party service only stores your unique Dropbox ID, not your login/password (the same ID used when you share a file using your 'Public' dropbox). While the service is mainly for sending email attachments to your Dropbox via email, it works just as well for plain text.  (As an aside, there are many other interesting <a href=\"http://wiki.dropbox.com/DropboxAddons \">Dropbox Addons</a>&nbsp;worth checking out).</p>\n<p>The trick, now, is how to get those plain text email messages from the Dropbox 'Attachments' folder to your synced notes folder. I used <a href=\"http://www.noodlesoft.com/\">Hazel</a> to accomplish this, establishing a rule to move any text file in the 'Attachments' folder to my 'SimpleText' folder.</p>\n<h3>That's it</h3>\n<p>The text for this post was harder to pull together than the syncing scheme. I spent a lot of time discussing EagleFiler. Even if you don't use this particular app, hopefully you'll get some new ideas about syncing folders. And if you've never used Notational Velocity, it's worth trying out. It's free, after all. NV is very easy to configure and is a great way to access your notes on your Mac.</p>\n<p>How does WriteRoom stack up against Simplenote? It's still a bit early for me to say. One thing I know I don't like: the app is requiring me to log in every time I open it. I hope this is fixed in a future release. It wouldn't be that big of a deal if I had a newer iPhone with iOS 4. With my old phone, however, I can't run apps in the background.</p>\n<p>As for looks, you can set up WriteRoom for iPhone to look quite similar to Simplenote. I prefer the default WriteRoom black background with white text.&nbsp;&nbsp;One nice touch that WriteRoom offers, akin to its big brother on the Mac, is the ability to edit notes in full-screen mode.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The WriteRoom web version of your notes looks like an old-old-school Mac text editor. Some may find that fun and retro, but it may be offputting if you're expecting a slick interface like that served up by Simplenote. Me? I rarely used the Simplenote online service, and I doubt I'll be logging into writeroom.ws very often.</p>\n<p>If you like tags in Simplenote, you'll be missing that in WriteRoom. There are ways you can tag, though. I use the same work-around that I used in 'pre-tag' Simplenote&mdash;by creating tags with text at the end of my documents (using the syntax &amp;tag: e.g. &amp;home, &amp;web). It works well enough for searching through many notes. &nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Since I gave Simplenote a year, I plan to stick with WriteRoom for the next year.&nbsp;</div>\n",

The desktop and keyboard tray surfaces are 3/4\" birch plywood edged with 2\" Radiata Pine. The legs are also constructed of Radiata Pine with birch plywood panels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The desk also sports a plywood bookshelf that forms the rear support for the corner piece. It serves to support the weight of the monitor, and the books and external hard drives stored there keep most of the cables, bricks, and power strips out of sight.</p>\n<p>The black material covering the wooden keyboard tray consists of two sheets of .99&cent; cent foam mat sold for children's craft projects, which I mounted with a light tacking glue that's easy to remove should the panels be damaged. The mat material is similar to what you'd get in a mouse pad, but it's thinner and firmer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1236e4b0b2818fdccae5/1296340700603/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1236e4b0b2818fdccae6/1296340702047/1000w\" alt=\"\" /></span></span>the desk using double-adhesive velcro strips. I mounted a USB hub under the desk to connect all of the devices.</p>\n<p>I also devised a simple wooden laptop stand to raise and angle the Macbook's monitor. I based the dimensions of the stand on the <a href=\"http://www.raindesigninc.com/mstand_specs.html\">technical specs of the Rain Design mStand</a>.</p>\n<p>I had to buy two items to complete the desk: an adjustable keyboard mount (without a tray, as I chose to make a custom oversized tray) and a monitor arm. The monitor arm is particularly nice as I can adjust height, depth, and angle of the monitor with ease.</p>\n<p>While the desk turned out well, it's worth noting that using wood from a hardware store chain isn't ideal. It's not furniture-grade material, and I don't have a jointer or a planer. So I had to do a fair amount of planing by hand to fix warps, bends, and thickness differences. Also, working with plywood can be maddening. The top layer of birch is so thin that it's scarily easy to sand right through it. As for tools, it required a table saw (with a dado blade), a mitre saw, a drill, a few hand planes, chisels, and a lot of clamps for the glue-up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project is complete, but there are a few things that could make it better. For instance, I'd love to mount a 30\" display on that monitor arm! And I'd like to take advantage of the fact that the monitor can be raised to standing height. The problem, of course, is that I'd need a raised platform to hold the keyboard and mouse. &nbsp;I'm envisioning a small tabletop lectern that I could mount to the front of the desk for times when I feel like standing up to compute. I'd want it to be hinged and collapsable so I could store it nearby. Hmm. I'll save that for another day.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

While I had planned to wait a while longer, I barely made it the first update (10.5.1). The buzz in the mac user community about the upgrade was positive enough to give me the confidence that it would be safe.  And it was. The upgrade was very smooth, and I have to say that I am more pleased with Leopard than I expected to be. I used the 'Archive and Install' method, which has never failed for me. This method ensures that any problems I might have in my previous OS installation are not carried forth into the new installation. Archive and Install simply means that the new operating system is installed after the previous OS system files are erased. The old OS system files are archived in folder labeled 'Previous System' on your mac (so they're not really erased). If you choose Archive and Install you will want to choose \"Preserve Users and Network Settings\" so that your existing user accounts and network settings are also copied over. I plan to keep my 'Previous System' folder for another few weeks before deleting it, just a precaution. Then I'll delete it. Oh, and before you upgrade, don't forget to <strong>BACKUP YOUR DATA</strong>!</p>\n<h3>A few tips to help you with the upgrade:</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use Archive and Install - I guess 'archive and install' is the preferred method for Apple, too ... check out this <a href=\"http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=6012089&amp;tstart=0\">Apple Support thread</a></li>\n<li>Uninstall or upgrade <a href=\"http://unsanity.org/archives/haxies/leopard.php\">APE</a> before you upgrade (if you have it installed). I do. My <strong>Logitech MX Revolution</strong> mouse uses APE (Application Enhancer), as does my installation of <strong>Audio Hijack Pro</strong>. You can find it at <em>Your Computer Name/Library/Preference Panes/Application Enhancer.prefPane</em>. I deleted APE, installed Leopard, then reinstalled the latest version.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://db.tidbits.com/article/9269\">Tidbits</a> offers a good overview of all known issues. If you don't <a href=\"http://db.tidbits.com/section/latest\">subscribe to Tidbits</a>, I highly recommend this weekly mac newsletter.</li>\n<li>If you haven't upgraded to Leopard yet, <a href=\"http://www.macfixit.com/article.php?story=20071023091749337\">MacFixIt has a great article to help you avoid problems</a> that you should read first.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br />If you're like me and enjoy reading about operating systems in painstaking detail, I recommend the <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/mac-os-x-10-5.ars\">review posted over on ArsTechnica</a>. A <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/2007/10/reviews/leopard_review/index.php\">lighter review</a> is available at <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com\">MacWorld</a>. Most of the complaints in the mac community about Leopard seem to be focused on the 3D dock (e.g. it's eye candy, it's hard to see, it's horrible), the new Firewall (there are no user settings anymore as there were on Tiger, it's dumbed down too much, it is turned <strong>off</strong> by default after the Leopard installation), Stacks (many people just don't think the fan and grid views are very user-friendly), and the menu bar (like the 3D dock, it is partly transparent so you can see the desktop picture through it - again, not very good from a accessibility standpoint - if you have poor eyesight, it can be hard to see what you're looking for). These issues are well documented, so I won't rehash them here. I expect that many of these annoyances will be fixed in future Apple updates. Fortunately, the mac user community are a talented bunch and many tricks and fixes are already out there to patch up many of things that may annoy you in Leopard. I'll leave you with a few links for some of the more fun ones I've seen so far:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Modify your Leopard</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://db.tidbits.com/article/9319\">Improve Stacks</a> with some beautifully designed icons from a mac user in Japan&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Change the Dock with <a href=\"http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/26125/dockchanger\">DockChanger (shareware)</a> or <a href=\"http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/26315/palette\">Palette (shareware) </a> or ... <a href=\"http://leoparddocks.com/index.html\">do it yourself for free!</a></li>\n<li>Use Terminal to <a href=\"http://www.macosxtips.co.uk/index_files/terminal-commands-for-hidden-settings-in-leopard.html\">change Leopard hidden settings</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Software Updates</h3>\n<p><br />The last topic I want to talk about concerns <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106704\">Apple software updates</a>. If you use 'Software Update' (from the Apple menu, choose 'Software Update') to upgrade from 10.5 to 10.5.1, you should know that the update you are receiving is a patch. If you are experiencing quirky problems after this maintenance update, try downloading the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/macosx1051update.html\">full update installer</a> and run it again. The full update is a much larger file. Instead of patching files, it completely replaces them with updated versions. I've found that this is generally the best way to install Apple OS updates. It's not as convenient as the built-in Software Update, but it may help prevent problems down the road. Full versions of updates are available on the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/downloads/\">Apple downloads site</a>.</p>\n",

That apparently equates to some 500 billion or so unique words.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I looked up 'cyberspace' on a whim. As expected, usage climbed following the release of William Gibson's 'Neuromancer' in 1984 (although <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a> notes that the first reference came from a Gibson short story in 1982).

It's a creation of web developer <a href=\"http://adactio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeremy Keith</a>, who says he originally invented this tool for himself to fill a simple need.</p>\n<p>Like many online tools with staying power, 'filling a simple need' is often the first litmus test for success. The second is filling a simple need <em>well</em>. And this site does the job very well. Huffduffer is an easy-to-use, elegant,&nbsp;friendly&nbsp;way to create your own personal podcast stream from found audio on the web. The part that makes Huffduffer so useful is RSS feed creation. It's easy to bookmark audio, but not so easy to create an iTunes-compatible RSS feed. I&nbsp;think of it this way: Huffduffer is to audio what <a href=\"http://www.instapaper.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Instapaper</a> is to text.</p>\n<p>I must admit, though, that I have only just started using this tool as intended. So far, I've primarily been using it as a discovery tool to find audio content I otherwise would not have known existed by subscribing to Huffduffer's '<a href=\"http://huffduffer.com/popular\" target=\"_blank\">Popular' feed</a>. As you may surmise, this feed delivers a steady stream of what other people are 'Huffduffing.'&nbsp;The downside to this stream is that there are often many duplicate posts, so you'll find yourself&nbsp;often&nbsp;deleting entries that you've seen before. The upside is that the content is usually interesting and there's plenty of new content every day. For my long daily train commute, this feed is most welcome.</p>\n<p>You'll find that much of the 'popular content' tends to be in the vein of tech, design, web design/development, science fiction, speculative science, and hard science. This surely says a lot about the core users of the site. And this makes sense given who created it: I surmise that site usage has spread mainly by word-of-mouth and via conferences. I, for instance, discovered it a web design conference where Jeremy Keith was speaking. So if you are particularly interested in this type of content, you'll get a lot out of this feed. As a secondary benefit, the popular feed has helped me find many a new podcast to subscribe to via iTunes. Now I need to start huffduffing some of my own 'found audio.'&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here are a few recent items from the 'popular' feed that I really enjoyed:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3739.html\" target=\"_blank\">Conversation with William Gibson</a>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;A discussion with William Gibson about where we are headed in the post-internet age.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sfoha.org/arthur-c-clarke-alvin-toffler-and-margaret-mead-on-mans-future/\" target=\"_blank\">Arthur C.

What you get is a box of sturdy plastic joints. What you add is your own lumber (2x4s and three panels of plywood or OSB). All told, I spent about $130. It only took about an hour to put together.  What it is: a sturdy workbench that‚Äôs easy to customize to a size that fits in any workspace. It gives you a rock-steady three-tiered storage system, a shelf and a big flat work space.  What it‚Äôs not: a carpentry bench. While it comes with some plastic clamps and hooks, they are not very useful. And the plastic corner pieces of the workbench prevent the installation of a fixed corner wood clamp because they aren't flush with the 2x4 frame. Still, it's an exceptional multipurpose surface with plenty of storage for wood and other odds and ends. Now I just need to build a carpentry bench to compliment it.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"alignright\" title=\"antique tools\" src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1216e4b0b2818fdccacd/1289701111005/#img.jpg1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"antique tools\" width=\"220\" height=\"240\" />Speaking of woodworking, I've been spending a lot of time and energy lately building up a solid collection of hand tools. There's an impulse to head to a big box store and buy new stuff. But I submit the best place to start is with antique stores. You know the old yarn about how 'things were made better then?' I've found that this is generally true for hand tools, provided you find ones that were well cared for. I picked up a level and sliding square made in the 1930s for a grand total of around $60. Sure, it's more than I'd pay for an aluminum level and cheap sliding square, but these are beautiful. They're built to last. They are made of heavy gauge stainless steel. As an added benefit, these old tools have character. </p>\n\n<p>Now that I have a fairly capable workshop in place, I'm ready to start building some shelves, cabinets, and furniture. While I have some experience, I would still classify myself as a noob. So I naturally headed to my Mac to seek out online and app solutions. No books for me. I'm happy to report that there's a lot available out there.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://sketchup.google.com/#utm_campaign=en&utm_source=en-ha-na-us-google&utm_medium=ha&utm_term=SketchUp\"><img class=\"alignright\" title=\"A plan from Google Sketchup\" src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1217e4b0b2818fdccace/1289701110987/#img.jpg.com/#utm_campaign=en&utm_source=en-ha-na-us-google&utm_medium=ha&utm_term=SketchUp\">Sketchup</a> design application. While I had installed this app a year or so ago to check it out, I didn't have a compelling use for it. Now I do. Carpentry. Here's an <a href=\"http://www.srww.com/sketchup-furniture-plans.htm\" target=\"_blank\">example of a detailed Trundle Bed design</a> that gives you a sense of some of the amazing free plans that are out there. This tool rocks. I plan to use it to sketch out all of my larger projects in the future, ranging from wood projects to garden plans to landscaping to interior designs. First, though, I have to learn how to use it through Google's <a href=\"http://www.google.com/sketchup/training/\" target=\"_blank\">extensive documentation</a>. As an aside, Sketchup would make a great iPad app. While I doubt we'll see that any time soon, wouldn't it be nice to see a company like OmniGroups create an iOS Sketchup-like tool ... perhaps an extension of OmniGraffle?</p>\n\n<p>So Sketchup promises to be a very helpful design and planning tool, but what I really need to get going in terms of woodworking is a dose of regimented instruction paired with a community of fellow woodworking enthusiasts (for motivation and to share experiences). I first checked out what was available around my neighborhood. While there are some courses at my local community college, the costs for these courses are steep. </p>\n\n<p>So I was happy to find a couple of really good sites to sign up for a low-cost online education. I haven't decided what I'm going to sign up for yet, but I've narrowed it down to two choices.\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://thewoodwhisperer.com/\"><img class=\"alignright\" title=\"The Wood Whisperer\" src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1218e4b0b2818fdccacf/1289701111913/#img.jpg/guild/\" target=\"_blank\">Guild</a> hosted by '<a href=\"http://thewoodwhisperer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wood Whisperer</a>.'  Membership is $149 a year (with lower cost options for six and three months). That's ridiculously affordable. I found this in a roundabout way by looking for woodworking podcasts, which lead me to an excellent series of instructional Wood Whisperer iOS videos. Based on what I've seen in these videos coupled with Guild user reviews, I'm pretty sure I'm going to try this out. Here's a sampling of what Guild membership entails: the opportunity to participate in three projects a year, videos and live demos to help you through said projects, access to all the archive projects (videos) should you want to try a former project, live interviews with leading industry pros to get answers to your questions, individual assistance with your projects, and a members-only forum to ask questions and share experiences with other Guild members.

This site is offering the <a href=\"http://www.renaissancewoodworker.com/hand-tool-school-intro/ target=\"_blank\">Hand Tool School</a>, a series of classes that's a self-described 'new approach to the traditional apprenticeship system.' I like the idea of learning the fundamentals of woodworking with hand tools. It's similar to the idea behind learning how to hand code a website before using a WYSIWYG editor. This looks like a winner. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, now that I'm diving into this head-first, I also checked for iOS apps that compliment the craft. Here's a round-up. </p>\n\n<p><strong>1. <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-woodshop-widget/id374838026?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">The Woodshop Widget</strong></a>. A two dollar app affiliated with the Wood Whisperer brand. Very helpful utilities including shellac mixing ratios, board foot calculations, tips, squareness testing, decimal to fraction conversions, and movement estimates for more than 230 wood types.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>2.<a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/woodworking-the-wood-whisperer/id396577949?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\"> Woodworking with the Wood Whisperer</strong></a>. A free app that provides access to archived episodes, social integration, and access to the live Wood Talk Online Radio podcast from the Wood Whisperer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/i-d-wood/id325838725?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">I.D. Wood</strong></a>. A five dollar pocket guide to nearly 160 different types of wood with information ranging from origins to common uses to durability to hardness. </p>\n\n<p>So I think I'm off to a good start. If you're interesting in this sort of thing, I hope this helps you get started as well.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Oh, for a distraction-free environment. Wouldn't we get so much done?</p>\n\n<p>I was combing through a backlog of unread feed items the other day, when I came across a <a href=\"http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/1169153343/only-you\" target=\"_blank\">parody from Merlin Mann</a> in which he pokes fun at the current glut of non-distracting writing tools on the market. He serves up a fictitious new tool called ≈´&mdash;, a writing environment that's so minimalistic that it displays only the top-half of your typed words. Funny stuff, but what's the message here?</p>\n\n<p>We know his intent, <a href=\"http://www.43folders.com/2010/10/05/distraction\" target=\"_blank\">thanks to a follow-up</a> in which he elaborates at great length on the original parody. It's an interesting read, albeit a long-winded rant (his self-diagnosis, with which I agree). While I found it a bit hard to get through this post, I was intrigued by the subject matter.</p>\n\n<p>The essential point that Mann makes is that distraction-free tools can be distractions in themselves. They will not make you a prolific, competent, energized person churning out chapters of engaging prose, nor will they make you a productivity guru. If you find yourself seeking out tool after tool with which to make yourself a more productive and focused writer, perhaps the problem is that you're expecting the tool to do the work for you. In contrast, if you're really motivated to write, you'll write on tree bark if necessary. The same principle applies to any other endeavor, digital or analog.</p>\n\n<p>So on one hand, Mann is criticizing the overblown language and suspect promises that sometimes accompany these types of tools. On the other, he serves up disdain for the type of person who collects such tools in a flailing attempt to fix an underlying concentration problem.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm interested in is this: why does the 'distraction-free' tool genre exist in the first place. Perhaps it's a reaction to how we're choosing to live our lives. Most of us feel the drag of information overload, the weight of too much clutter, the barrage of too many activities. Much of this is self-inflicted. When we work on a task, we too often monitor e-mails, Twitter and Facebook accounts, phone calls, and text messages. These distractions hamper our ability to concentrate on single tasks for extended periods of time. We think we can multitask, but we most of us really can't.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we all know that the only way to write in a concentrated manner is to muster the willpower to focus on one task to the exclusion of all others. That's what concentration is all about. It requires no special tools. It does not require a full-screen mode, nor pleasant imagery, nor ambient sound. True enough. But we like this stuff. As a society, we seem to have a tendency to look for tools or plans or guides to help us muster the self-control we seek. While we know that a tool cannot solve our concentration problem, that doesn't stop us from seeking tools that do just that. So here's one view on this current fad: the genre exists because there is a growing demand for environments that simulate concentration. We're seeking a concentration prosthetic.</p>\n\n<p>Another view is that the 'distraction-free' tool genre is a reaction to the bloated, overpowered software that most of us have used for years. What do we need to write, after all? Not very much. What is most like a blank piece of paper? A blank piece of paper. What about a blank piece of paper with subtle background imagery and gentle sound effects? Why not. Distraction-reducing writing tools provide an uncrowded, narrowly-focused experience that just may spur us to concentrate a bit more. There's nothing wrong with that. If this alternate view seems like a slightly different take on the first, that's because it is. As I said, it's all about degrees of expectation.</p>\n\n<p>The point is that distraction-reducing writing tools can only do so much, but that's not to say that they are useless. Why not try a writing tool that is pleasant, simple, and relatively inexpensive? We routinely choose analog tools based on preferences that balance form and functionality. We create our living spaces in much the same way. And so we are now offered a wide range of tools in the digital space for the task of writing.</p>\n\n<p>So I say embrace this trend. Experiment. But try to do so with minimal expectations. And always remember that the 'map is not the territory.' Personally, I enjoy so-called 'distraction-reducing' writing tools. I use a few for specific tasks. I find that <a href=\"http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom\" target=\"_blank\">WriteRoom</a>, for instance, is a wonderful tool for writing long documents. I like the looks of it. It reminds me of writing on WordPerfect on the first computer I ever used back in the 80s. <a href=\"http://www.ommwriter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OmmWriter</a>? It's a bit over-the-top, but I can customize it to suit me. At times I find it to be a very pleasant environment in which to write poetry or short stories. What I enjoy about these tools is less about reducing distractions and more about aesthetics.</p>\n\n<p>I didn't take Mann's parody or his meta-post about the parody as a condemnation of such tools. His broader message has little to do with software. It's about how we work, or should. The best part is at the end:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\"Learn your real math, and any slide rule will suffice. Try, make, and do until you quit noticing the tools, and if you still think you need new tools, go try, make, and do more.\"</blockquote>\n\n<p>I like the '<em>quit noticing the tools</em>' part the best. That's what we're striving for.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>It's been a while. I've been living in a hotel since the last post (yes, since the end of April). During that time, I discovered that hotel life renders me apathetic and extremely unmotivated. What little energy I could muster was spent trying to find a new home and trying to be productive at work. As is surely obvious, I was not at all motivated to maintain this blog. This lack of motivation was bolstered by shoddy hotel bandwidth, which rendered any web-based activities quite painful.</p>\n<p>That said, it's now over. We're now in a new home with a decent broadband connection.   While I've studiously ignored this blog for months, I have thought about it quite a lot. Do I still enjoy it? Do I want to keep it going? My conclusion: I do want to keep it alive, but I'm going to shift the focus a bit. I'm no longer going to focus my writing on Mac-related tech. The volume of Mac-related content on the web has exploded since I started this project. There's a glut of Apple-focused review-commentary-ramblings out there. So this blog is going to turn into something a little different. There will still be Apple-related posts, surely. But I'm going to shift to a wider range of topics. It'll be an experiment, as it's always been. Expect to see a lot of tech-related posts. But also expect to see other topics that stray into other areas of that interest me. While a general rule of thumb is to keep one's blog focused on a narrow niche to build readership, I'm choosing to ignore that. We'll see what happens.</p>\n<p>In other news, I've just migrated from a self-hosted Wordpress site to <a href=\"http://www.squarespace.com\" target=\"_blank\">Squarespace</a>. Why? I'll save the full details on what I like (and don't like) about this new service for a later post. The main reason for the switch, though, is that it will allow me to focus more on content. When I started this blog, web development was something I only did through this venue and through some for-hire work. Now, my current job fully scratches this itch. I'm knee-deep in it most of the day. So my Squarespace migration is a move towards letting others worry about the details. This is not to say that the free Wordpress.org solution isn't a great choice. It is. But it takes more time and vigilance than I care to invest at this point.</p>\n<p>The site will remain named 'View from the Dock.' When I started this blog, I chose this name because of the obvious reference to the Apple Dock. But I also liked the name because it could mean a <em>view from a dock</em>. As in a dock in the water, overlooking a lake. That's more of where I'm at now.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "Over the past few months, a slew of interesting little tools made the rounds in various tech blogs. I thought I'd compile some of the more interesting ones here (and add a few of my personal favorites):<br/><br/><br/><h3><a href=\"http://www.stereopsis.com/flux/\" target=\"_blank\"> f.lux</a></h3><br/>This free tool auto-adjusts the color temperature of your display(s) to match the time of day and your lighting source. The night mode is much easier on the eyes. Very pleasant. It can be temporarily disabled for those times when you're engaged in a design project and need full color.<br/><br/>Alternative: <a href=\"http://www.blacktree.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nocturne</a> (from the developer of QuickSilver) offers 'night vision mode for your Mac.' It's not nearly as subtle and elegant as f.lux, but you can adjust the settings to your liking. It's especially great if you like it <em>really</em> dark when you're computing at night...or if you like funky, inverted color schemes.<br/><br/><h3><a href=\"http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/\" target=\"_blank\">Cinch</a></h3><br/>The answer to Windows 7 'Snap' feature, this $7 tool allows you to instantly resize any open window by dragging it to an edge of your screen. It's particularly great for managing multiple Finder windows on a small laptop screen. I use <a href=\"http://cocoatech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PathFinder</a> (which offers dual pane and tabbed browsing to the Finder) and don't really feel that I have a need for this, but it's a great tool nonetheless. <br/><br/><h3><a href=\"http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/\" target=\"_blank\">Readability</a></h3><br/>This is the only way to read articles on the Web. It removes all the extra formatting, ads, buttons, colors, and other clutter that surrounds a typical Web-based article, leaving only the text you want to read.<br/><br/>I use Readability for articles I want to read <em>now</em>, and <a href=\"http://www.instapaper.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Instapaper</a> for articles I want to read <em>later</em> on my iPhone (using the <a href=\"http://www.instapaper.com/iphone\" target=\"_blank\">Instapaper Pro iPhone app</a>).<br/><br/><h3><a href=\"http://www.choosyosx.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Choosy</a></h3><br/>If you're like me and have many installed browsers, this $12 tool is a necessity. It allows you to choose which browser to use when opening an external link or when opening up an HTML file. You can also add other apps to the list. I have Choosy set to prompt me with a pop-up list of all browsers (prioritized with my favorites appearing first in the list), regardless of whether or not the browsers are running. I've also added MacRabbit's <a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Espresso</a> as a 'browser' to send HTML files direct to this web development tool.<br/><br/>Alternative: I haven't tried this one, but you may also want to check out <a href=\"http://www.heliumfoot.com/highbrow\" target=\"_blank\">Highbrow</a>. <br/><br/><h3><a href=\"http://www.ommwriter.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">OmmWriter</a></h3><br/>A unique tool that's still in Beta (so it's free to try), Ommwriter delivers a full-screen, clutter-free writing environment. This app focuses on setting the mood to foster a creative spirit, offering several nice fonts, a choice of ethereal background sounds, and a variety of subtle keyboard clicking noises that I find annoying (the sounds can be turned off). <br/><br/>I still prefer the retro simplicity of <a href=\"http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom\" target=\"_blank\">WriteRoom</a> from Hog Bay Software when I need to focus on writing. I use it in combination with Hog Bay's <a href=\"http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/quickcursor/\" target=\"_blank\">QuickCursor</a>, a wonderful little tool that allows me to edit text from other applications with WriteRoom.<br/><br/><h3><a href=\"http://rapportive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rapportive</a></h3><br/>Rapportive replaces the ads you normally see in the right-hand sidebar of Gmail with useful information: a profile of the person you're emailing. It only works in Firefox and Chrome right now, but I use it via <a href=\"http://mailplaneapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mailplane</a> (available in the latest <a href=\"http://mailplaneapp.com/download/preview/\" target=\"_blank\">preview</a>). <br/><br/>As an aside, if you use Mailplane, you may like the beautifully minimalist <a href=\"http://www.josefrichter.com/helvetimail/\" target=\"_blank\">Helvetimail</a> style sheet.<br/><br/><h3><a href=\"http://blog.boastr.net/?page_id=195\" target=\"_blank\">SecondBar</a></h3><br/>This tool places an Apple menu bar on your second monitor. I use it. It works well enough, providing basic menu bar functionality on the extra monitor. It's quite nice to have the bar on both screens, although it doesn't work with all apps (that's because it's still in early Beta). It's currently free.<br/><br/><h3><a href=\"http://quixapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Quix</a></h3> <br/>Quix is an extensible bookmarklet, billed as 'command line for your browser.' While it takes some time to learn the commands to use with this tool, it's worth the effort. I love it.<br/><br/><h3><a href=\"http://skitch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Skitch</a></h3><br/>This tool is certainly not new, but it stands apart as the easiest way to capture and mark up screen shots.

Many people, it seems, feel that Together is a lot like Yojimbo. That's certainly true. However, one could also argue that it's very similar to EagleFiler. The truth is in the middle, as is so often the case. Together marries some of the best features of EagleFiler and Yojimbo. But it also stands apart by offering the slickest interface I've seen so far. It's polished and fast, and a real pleasure to use.<br /><br /> <a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc818/1282612170997/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc811/1282612170957/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Together UI\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n<h3>What it looks like</h3>\n<p><br />Together's structure and filing system is similar to that of iTunes, as is the case with many Mac apps (particularly in this genre). It serves up your basic three-pane structure. In the lefthand-column source list, you'll find your Library (which contains all items that you've imported). <br /><br />The Library is broken down into subcategories that are pre-defined by Together, such as notes, documents, images, and videos. These are <em>smart groups</em>, meaning that they are automatically populated with items you've added to your Library (sorted by file type). While you can't modify these 'standard' groups, you can delete them if you want. You can get the deleted standard group back later if you change your mind by selecting 'View Options' from the menu bar.  <br /><br />Under the pre-set groups lie user-defined groups, which may contain smart folders, regular folders, or groups. Groups are like playlists in iTunes. Smart folders contain items that meet your selected search criteria. Folders are just plain old folders. It all works as expected. Notably, the app offers the ability to nest folders if you're the type who likes to organize files in this fashion. Like Yojimbo, and unlike EagleFiler, each folders/groups show the number of items within each container, which is a nice visual cue.<br /><br />Also similar to other apps we've looked at, selecting one group (or folder) from the source list presents you with a list in the righthand-column of all items that are in that group. Selecting one of these items presents a preview of the item. There are a couple of design choices, though, that make Together different from the other apps I've looked at. First, you can choose landscape mode, which is visually outstanding and particularly nice for wide screen monitors). Second, the 'Info View' (the place where you add metadata such as tags and comments) is tightly integrated into the main viewing window, so there's no need to open up another pane to get these fields. I really like the way this is designed. It makes it very easy to see (or add) details for a given item. The metadata options and layout, in fact, are the best I've seen. It just looks great, particularly in landscape mode. Although I didn't really make use of it, it's worth noting that Together provides the option to rate ('star') items just as in iTunes. I also like that the metadata field presents a visual path of where a given item is located in the Library (and with a quick double-click, the Finder pops open to reveal the source file).<br /><br /> <a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc819/1282612171007/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc812/1282612171037/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Tag View\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a> <br /><br />Together takes a different approach for how tags are displayed. With Yojimbo or EagleFiler, tags are front and center. With Together, you get to your Tags by toggling views from the bottom bar of the app. The Tag view is just what you'd expect: your group (folder) structure in the source list is replaced with a view of all of the tags used in your Library. It allows you to quickly see your tags, create new tags, and sort through multiple tags. You can also drop new items into your Library on top of a tag to inherit that tag name. The tag view looks great and it's a good use of limited space.  However, I suspect it may discourage use for those who aren't already tag warriors, simply because tags aren't visible in the default view. Take a look at the screenshots to get a sense of what each viewing mode looks like. I'll talk about the other main visual element of Together &mdash; the Shelf &mdash; in a moment.</p>\n<h3>Capturing data</h3>\n<p><br />As with all of the apps in this genre that I've looked at, Together offers a host of ways to import items into the Library. And you can choose how you want to import an item: add it to the Library while leaving the original item in place, move the item into the Library, or link to an  <a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc81a/1282612171133/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc813/1282612171107/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"drag and drop\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a> external item without touching it. My preference is to move files into the Library so there are no duplicates to worry about. Since Together stores files in an open system, doing so doesn't lock said file up in a database&mdash;an important consideration that I'll touch on later. As for file importing methods, you can drag and drop files or folders into the Library, or into a specific folder, or into a tag group; you can also print items to Together as PDF files; add items to the Library based on what's currently in your clipboard (which is handy for capturing selected text); capture via a quick import key combo; or drag and drop into Together's Shelf.  <br /><br />Speaking of Web pages, Together competently handles links. In the app's preferences you can set if you want your links saved as bookmarks or as Web archives. If you're just interested in capturing text from a page, you can also choose to import it as rich text or as an archive.<br /><br />You can also add items via the Services menu. Curiously, the Services items did not automatically show up when I installed Together, although they should have according to the Help files. I had to access the Services menu in System Preferences (filed under Keyboard &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts in case you're looking for it) and manually turn on Together's three Services options: add, move, or link to Together.<br /><br /> <a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc81b/1282612171217/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc814/1282612171016/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"the shelf\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n<h3>The shelf</h3>\n<p><br /><br />With Together, neither Services nor manually dragging and dropping files into the app are the preferred way to import new items. That distinction goes to the aptly named Shelf. Usually, I'm not a big fan of shelfs (those little sliding dock-like elements that hang out on an edge of one's screen). I think they're often distracting and lacking in utility. To my surprise, I warmed up to the Together implementation. <br /><br />There are several things I like about it. First, it doesn't pop open when my mouse bumps against the screen edge. I have to click on it to open it. Second, it's integrated with a user-defined system-wide key combo. With Yojimbo, a system-wide key combo opens up a sliding window from the menu bar, presenting the user with an additional input menu distinct from the Yojimbo shelf and application. With EagleFiler, you can set a key combo that pops open a new window in the middle of the screen in which you can add metadata prior to import. <br /><br />But with Together, invoking the user-defined key combo activates the Shelf in 'import mode,' a special panel where one can add metadata to an item upon import (this works via dragging and dropping files on the Shelf as well). I want to be clear here. I'm not saying that I don't like the way EagleFiler and Yojimbo handle importing files. I'm saying that the Together implementation is very elegant. I like the way the Shelf centralizes several functions in one place. When it's not importing items, the Shelf serves up three other functions: quick access to your Library, folders, smart folders, and groups (complete with QuickLook integration); access to your 'Favorite' items, groups, or folders; and a place to type in a quick note to add to Library. Check the screenshot to see what I mean. So the Shelf, in total, serves up four different functions in one small bit of screen real estate. And it's a flexible way to import items in one other respect: you can also drag a file to a <em>specific folder or group</em> in your Library right through the Shelf, which saves a step in the filing process. <br /><br />What could make it better? The ability to see your Tag structure in the Shelf, and the ability to drag new items onto a tag on the Shelf to automatically adopt that tag. And speaking of tags, while the Shelf import panel does allow one to enter tags for new items (it's one of several offered metadata fields), there is no way to see what tags you're already using in your Library without going back to the main app window and switching over to the 'Tag' view. It would be nice to have a way to select previously used tags right from the Shelf. Lastly, the 'Quick Note' field in the Shelf is handy, but is a few features short of being great&mdash;I'd like to have the ability to add metadata to that new note before it's imported, and I'd like to be able to file that new note in a specific place right from the Shelf. <br /><br /> <a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc81c/1282612170082/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc815/1282612170853/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Files in the Finder\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Adding files via the Finder</h3>\n<p><br />I have one final point to make about importing items. Together, like EagleFiler, allows you to add new items to the Library right in the Finder, even when the application is closed. This is possible thanks to the flat file structure of these programs, which means that the files are stored right in the Finder external of any database. Why would you want to add items via the Finder? Consider the following scenario using the excellent file-organizing tool <a href=\"http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php\" target=\"_blank\">Hazel</a> from Noodlesoft. Say you're working on a project and you don't have Together running. You've been saving files to your desktop for hours. When your project is completed and ready for filing, you could open up Together and manually import these new items, or you could drag them to your Together folder of choice within the Finder<strong>*</strong>. But with Hazel, you can set up rules, for instance, to tag all documents on your desktop with the word 'project,' label each with the color red, and then send the files to your Together &gt; Documents &gt; Projects folder. Running your user-defined rules, then, whisks your files away and places them in the folder of your choice, ready for you to manage the next time you open up Together. What I like to do is leave Hazel's auto-filing turned off. That way, I can explicitly run the rules I've created when I'm ready. In one step, my desktop is cleared and my files are, well, filed.<br /><br /><em><strong>*</strong>Here's something that's really cool about Together. You can set the app to automatically import files that you place in <em>any</em> of Together's Library folders located in the Finder (except for the Support and Trash folders). That means that you can dump image files into the Documents folder even when the app is closed, and Together will automatically move the image files to the proper 'Images' folder the next time it runs. However, if you want an item to be imported into a <em>particular</em> user-created folder, you'll need to place it there. That's where Hazel can be quite handy.  Note, though, that if you place an image file in a user-created folder (which may contain any kind of file), Together will still provide an alias (link) to that file in the default 'Images' folder in your Library.</em><br /><br /> <a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc81d/1282612170733/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc816/1282612170077/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Working with Files\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Working with files</h3>\n<p><br />Working with files is about the same as the other apps I've looked at. QuickLook is available (for supported file formats). You can choose to edit many text documents from within the app using a built-in editor, and you can double-click on any item to edit it in its default external application. One stand-out feature is the ability to open items up in tabs, which makes it easy work to keep several documents open at once for ferrying text around.<br /><br />One other notable item is how the source menu automatically generates a group called 'Recent Imports' that tells you (you guessed it) when and how many files you've recently imported. You can clear this list when it gets too long, or you can hide it altogether. I found it to be a useful way to keep track of recent imports so that I could further categorize, tag, or add additional metadata to items at a time of my choosing.<br /><br />Now for some odds and ends. <br /><br />I've touched on this already, but it bears repeating: Together stores your files in an open structure. I'm a huge fan of this, as I noted in my EagleFiler review, because it means that your files and metadata are all in tact and available through the Finder. If you ever decide to abandon Together, you don't have to export anything. And you don't have to worry about your metadata being lost.<br /><br />If you want to create multiple libraries with Together, you can do it. But be warned that, unlike Eaglefiler, Together only allows you to have one Library open at a time. If you want the ability to move files around between Libraries, this is probably not your best choice.<br /><br />The final point to make is about encryption. Like Yojimbo, Together allows you to encrypt on a per-item basis. EagleFiler only allows you to encrypt an entire Library (all or nothing). While I initially preferred per-item encryption, I've changed my mind. Here's why. Encrypted items are not indexed, because doing so would render the content of the file unencrypted. There is also the potential that if you choose to encrypt an item later, the contents of that item may already be indexed, and hence unencrypted. So while per-item encryption is handy, it's not ideal. The alternative to this is the way EagleFiler handles encryption, which is at the Library level (both the index for the encrypted Library and the contents of the entire Library are encrypted). This is arguably a more secure set up, with the added benefit that the encrypted items remain fully searchable (but only when the encrypted Library is unlocked and in use).  For the average user, this may not be that big of a deal. However, it is an important point to consider if you intend to encrypt some of your data using Together or another similar tool.</p>\n<h3>Verdict</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>1. Could I figure out how to use the app with minimal fuss (w/o documentation)?</h4>\n<p><br />Together is pretty easy to figure out, but I did need to refer to the manual at times when I first started using it. Mostly, this was to look up specific questions, such as how and where to set up a quick-input key combo.  The documentation is pretty good. It's much less than that provided by EagleFiler, but much more than is provided by Yojimbo. This backs up my contention that this app falls somewhere in between these two competitors!</p>\n<h4>2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the app after several weeks of use?</h4>\n<p>Yes. I am now certain that I prefer Together over Yojimbo. I'd say that EagleFiler is still my top choice at this point, mainly because I've learned a lot about the guts of how these programs work as I've tested them out, and it strikes me as the most scalable, flexible and secure option I've yet seen. That's not to say that Together is not scalable, flexible, and secure. It's a matter of degrees. I think Together would handily meet the needs of most users. Where Together beats EagleFiler hands down is on style and user interface.</p>\n<h4>3. How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?</h4>\n<p>Other than my minor issue with the Apple Services menu, it integrated flawlessly. To my surprise, I especially grew to appreciate the Shelf: it didn't feel like it got in my way, but it was there when needed.</p>\n<h4>4. How did it feel?</h4>\n<p>Here's where I think Together really shines. It looks and feels great. I particularly like the landscape viewing mode, the integrated metadata fields, and the tabs. My only complaint is that the tag structure gets a bit neglected because it's in not visible on the top level (and tags are not visible from the Shelf).  I want to stress how much I like the metadata input panel&mdash;I love how it's always visible, and its elegant design makes it that much easier to maintain and manage a somewhat tedious aspect of file management.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p><br /><br />How does Together <a href=\"/2009/12/mip-making-info-perform/#triangle\" target=\"_blank\">fit on the triangle</a>? I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s about 70% file organizer; 25% notebook; 5% visualizer<br /><br /><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc817/1282612170068/#img.jpg1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Together Triangle Plot\" width=\"520\" height=\"255\" /><br /><br />I see Together as a marriage of some of the best aspects of Yojimbo and EagleFiler. That's not to say this app is a copycat. Far from it. It offers the best interface that I've seen so far, it feels polished and fast, and it's a pleasure to use. I would recommend it to those who appreciate style, like the idea of open file storage, and want a solid general-purpose tool to help manage a bunch of files and snippets. Together costs $39.

It's a 2.6 pound monster with German-engineered mechanical gold-plated key switches. It's designed for performance, durability, and loudness. Yes, loudness. If you miss the audible feedback from keyboards of yore, this is for you. To give you a sense of how loud it is, the company also sells reusable earplugs. It's expensive (over $100), but if you like this sort of thing, you probably can't do better. <br /><br />Me, I prefer silence while I type. But what appealed to me about Das Keyboard is that the company offers a model without <em>any</em> key markings. I'm a Dvorak typist, so I rarely look at the keyboard anyway. Some part of me thinks it would be great fun to have a keyboard with blank keys, mainly because it would satisfy my inner Secret Squirrel impulses.<br /><br />Reading about Das Keyboard reminded me of a post I wrote in 2008 about the <a href=\"http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus\" target=\"_blank\">Optimus Maximus</a>, an industrial art creation from the studios of Art. Lebedev. At the time this fancy keyboard was still in development, but it's now available for purchase. Cost-wise, it makes Das Keyboard look like a great bargain. It costs $2,400. No, that is not a typo. <br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.artlebedev.com/studio/\"><img class=\"alignright\" title=\"Optimus Maximus\" src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc809/1282612115977/#img.png1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Maximus Optimus\" width=\"169\" height=\"167\" /></a>Why so expensive? First, it's not a mass market product. It's produced by an impressive design studio with a guiding business principle of '<a href=\"http://www.artlebedev.com/studio/\" target=\"_blank\">no bullshit</a>.' Hard not to like that. If you buy one, you can say you own a 'work of Art.' Second, it's a fantastic-looking keyboard and, as far as I know, the only one of its kind. Each key is an independent stand-alone OLED display. That means that each key can transform into whatever you need it to be. While this is great for Dvorak typists, imagine the possibilities for people who want to change key functions for different languages, for games, or for application-specific functions.  Check out the <a href=\"http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/demo/\" target=\"_blank\">demo</a>. <br /><br />Back in 2008, rumors were circulating about the possibility of an Apple keyboard that also used OLED keys. I'm still waiting for it. I would bet that it already exists, hidden away in a secret lab, just waiting for mass technology to catch up so it can be released at a relatively affordable price. I still think, as I did in 2008, that this the future of keyboards. The question, of course, is if there <em>is</em> a future for keyboards. Will we still use these devices in 2020?</p>\n",

For those who can't afford the pricey Adobe Creative Suite apps, note that this suite is a surprisingly powerful alternative. <br /><br />I like to think of Aviary as a creative playground.

				"content_text": "<p><a title=\"Yojimbo 2\" href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/Yojimbo/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7f0/1282612082207/#img.png.com/products/Yojimbo/\" target=\"_blank\">Yojimbo</a> was one of the better information managers on the market when I reviewed it back in March 2008. Yojimbo 2 was released last November. This new release sports more than a new logo (as an aside, I'm sad to see the old logo go. It went well with the product name). Anyway, the new version addresses most of the concerns I had about the first version&mdash;the main item being that Yojimbo's tagging structure needed work, particularly in light of the fact that Yojimbo emphasizes the tag as a primary organization tool. Now, that problem is fixed. Here, then, is a brief look at what's new.</p>\n<h3>Tag Explorer</h3>\n<p><br /> <a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7f4/1282612115913/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7f1/1282612115937/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Tag Explorer overview\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a> The single most important feature of Yojimbo 2 is the new Tag Explorer. It's a clever implementation. The Bare Bones team says it's a way to look at your collection of items from the 'inside out.' What that means is best understood by actually using it, but I'll attempt to explain how it works in words by way of example. <br /><br />Say I want to sift through all the items in my Library to find specific documents related to this blog (tag: 'vfd') and Linux (tag: 'linux'). Assume I haven't created any subfolders to organize my files, so I start by selecting my Library to reveal a list of all the files contained within my Yojimbo database.<br /><br />Once I select my Library, the Tag Explorer reveals all tags used throughout my entire collection, along with an annotation of the number of times the tag is used.  In my case, I have 32 items in my Library marked with 'vfd.' I want to find items tagged with both 'vfd' and 'Linux,' so I start by selecting 'vfd' from the Tag Explorer. Three things then happen: <br /><br />1. The items in my Library are instantly filtered so that I only see the specific files tagged with 'vfd.'<br /><br />2. The tag filter I've chosen ('vfd') is promoted to the Tag Filter bar (new in Yojimbo 2) that appears above the list of Library items. If you've used tagging in other apps, the appearance of the 'promoted' tag will be familiar. It makes it very easy to see which filter is currently being applied to your document list. Take a look at the screen shot if you want to see what I'm talking about.<br /><br />3. The Tag Explorer view changes to reveal only tags related to 'vfd.' What does 'related to' mean? In my case, I have many items that use the tag 'vfd' that are also tagged with other keywords. So what I see in the Tag Explorer is that, of the 36 items in my library tagged with 'vfd,' four items are also tagged with the word 'linux,' 14 items are also tagged 'post drafts,' two items are also tagged 'wordpress,' and so on. <br /><br />If I then choose the 'linux' tag from the Tag Explorer, that tag is then promoted to the Tag Filter bar. I now have two filter parameters in place: 'vfd' and 'linux.' And, as you would expect, I'm presented with a list of the items in my Library that are tagged with the words 'vfd' AND 'linux.' At this point, the Tag Explorer bar appears empty because there are no other related tags. In other words, I've drilled down as far as I can go. <br /><br />Once I'm ready to search for something else, I deselect the tags 'vfd' and 'linux' from the Tag Filter Bar.  Voil&agrave;, I'm back to the complete list of all items in my Library.<br /><br />Yojimbo still features the handy, familiar option of organizing with static folders, in which you can collect whatever you want. But the best way to manage folders with this app continues to be the Tag Collection. These smart folders work as you'd expect: choose the tag (or tags) you're interested in, and the folder will magically populate with items that match that criteria. New to Yojimbo 2, tag collections now allow you to choose if you want your folder to group together <em>all</em> items in your Library that match a selection of tags, or <em>any</em> items that match a selection of tags. That's very useful.<br /><br />There is one other improvement to mention related to tags, and that's the Tag editor. You'll find it under Window &gt; Show Tags. The editor presents a list of all of the tags used in your Library, along with number counts. It's the same view that you see from the Tag Explorer if you select your Library as a starting point. What's special about this view is that it allows you to easily batch manage tags: change a tag name, delete a tag, or merge two different tags. These changes are implemented Library-wide. It works great, but be careful. The 'merge' and 'delete' tag commands cannot be undone. Also note that the merge command works with as many tags as you wish to merge together, but your newly-merged tag set will adopt the name of the top-most tag in your selected group. The Tag editor is actually a dual-purpose tool that also contains a Label editor. Here, you can batch change label names and label colors. You can also delete labels. However, you can't merge multiple labels. <br /><br />I think Yojimbo nails it with the new tagging features. However, if you only have 100 or so items in your Library, you may find that organizing your items by folder remains the easiest way to go. But if you're dealing with a huge Library with items tagged with multiple names, it can be a huge time saver.  My only complaint with the new tagging setup is that the Tag editor (Window &gt; Show Tags) is not easy to get to. It's a minor thing, but it'd be nice to have a key combo option to pull this up. It might also be nice to have the option to place a shortcut (icon) for 'Tags' in Yojimbo's Toolbar for easy access.</p>\n<h3>Other Refinements</h3>\n<p><br /><br /> <a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7f5/1282612115867/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7f2/1282612115089/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Other Refinements\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a> There are number of other nice refinements in Yojimbo 2, my favorite of which is the improved Quick Input panel. As in the last version of Yojimbo, selecting F8 pulls up this panel. And as before, Yojimbo guesses which kind of item you're trying to create based on what's in your clipboard. It typically guesses correctly in my experience. What's new here is that you can now add more metadata to the item you're creating (name, tags, flags, label, and comments). This makes the Quick Input much like that of EagleFiler, and it's a handy way to knock out the finer points of filing right from the start. Chances are (if you're like me) you won't otherwise get around to it later.<br /><br />The Drop Drock also received a minor refresh in this update. New is the ability to drag and drop items to a Tag Collection to auto-assign tags; and you can now flag items by dropping on a 'Flagged Items' zone. As I said in my EagleFiler review, I prefer this kind of screen-edge style for Drop Docks because it's easier to access. Truth told, though, I'm not a big Drop Dock fan for purely aesthetic reasons. I prefer to use a key command to enter new items.  That said, Yojimbo does a good job with this.<br /><br />Searching for items in Yojimbo is also supposed to be faster now, but I didn't notice the difference. That's likely because my Library is not that big. Search was already very fast in my experience. Added to the speed improvement, search now auto-completes tag and label names for you as you type. You can also refine where you're searching by holding down the Option key and selecting multiple collections (folders). <br /><br />While I think the new Tag Explorer is great, I tend to use the Search function with more frequency because it's faster. By selecting the magnifying glass in the search field, you can choose to search only tags, content, the comment field, name of an item, or all of the above. I like to leave mine set to 'Tag.' I found that I could generally find what I'm looking for faster this way than with the Tag Explorer. Again, with a really large Library, this likely wouldn't work as well. The more items in your Library, the more tags you have, and the harder it will be to remember the name you used to tag something.<br /><br />Last up, Yojimbo 2 also improved their PDF workflow in this release. If you choose to print an item from another application and save as a PDF to Yojimbo, you now how an option to add metadata to the PDF before it's printed.</p>\n<h3>The Verdict</h3>\n<p><br /><br />For long-time users of Yojimbo, this new release delivers some great improvements that make it a worthwhile upgrade. For new users, it remains one of the best solutions I've seen to easily capture snippets of info, mainly because it's so easy to use.</p>\n<h4>1. Could I figure out how to use the application with minimal fuss (without documentation)?</h4>\n<p><br />As I noted in my first Yojimbo review, the developer maintains that there is &lsquo;no learning curve.&rsquo; This is largely true, although you may find the Tag Explorer a little weird at first until you get used to it.</p>\n<h4>2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?</h4>\n<p><br />Yes. With the addition of more robust tagging support and improvements in ease of adding metadata to files, Yojimbo has answered the mail for most of the issues I had with the first release.</p>\n<h4>3. How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?</h4>\n<p><br />Very well. There are a variety of ways to get things into Yojimbo that are all tightly integrated. Yojimbo supports MobileMe syncing for other Yojimbo installations on your network. Yojimbo data is also Spotlight indexed.</p>\n<h4>4. How did the program &lsquo;feel?&rsquo; How &lsquo;Mac-like&rsquo; is it?</h4>\n<p><br />This application has a great feel to it. The minimalist interface and the eye-catching iconography make it a real pleasure to use.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p><br />How does Yojimbo fit on the <a href=\"/2009/12/mip-making-info-perform/#triangle\" target=\"_blank\">triangle</a>? I'd say it's about 25% file organizer; 70% notebook; 5% visualizer. <br /><br /><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7f3/1282612082223/#img.png1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"EagleFiler Triangle Plot\" width=\"520\" height=\"255\" /><br /><br />So far, I've reviewed EagleFiler and Yojimbo. Yojimbo is a reliable, speedy and handy tool. With this new release, I think Bare Bones maintains the products broad appeal, especially for those who want a general-purpose, easy to use snippet box to hold a wide range of items for easy retrieval. The new tagging features are easy to use and may get some people who've never tried this organization method to give it a go. Those who rely heavily on tagging will most appreciate this update, though.<br /><br />EagleFiler still stands out to me as a better 'industrial strength' choice for file organization, and I'm still partial to a flat file storage solution vs. the database storage of Yojimbo. The main reason for that is about my future usage: if I stop using EagleFiler at some point in the future, I don't have to export my files. There's nothing to export. And all of my tags and labels will be maintained. However, when I export my Yojimbo items, the tags and labels are lost (unless I'm missing something?). If I intend to keep using Yojimbo forever, this wouldn't be an issue. But I'm not sure I want to make such a long-term commitment. <br /><br />I haven't decided if I'll upgrade to Yojimbo 2 yet. I'm going to wait until I finish this review series to make the choice. I very well may end up using more than one tool, and there's certainly room for that in this category of Mac app.<br /><br />Yojimbo is offered at $39. An upgrade version is available for registered version 1.0 users for $20. There is a full 30-day trial available to test it out.<br /><br />Next up on the Mac <a href=\"/2009/12/mip-making-info-perform/\" target=\"_blank\">MIP review series</a> is an examination of <a href=\"http://www.reinventedsoftware.com/together/\" target=\"_blank\">Together</a> from Reinvented Software. I'm just beginning my trial period now, so please be patient!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7e6/1282612082025/#img.gif1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"The Sustainable Network\" width=\"180\" height=\"236\" /> <br /><br />The global network is a nebulous thing that many of us take for granted. What began simply as a way to connect up a few computers has grown into something greater than the sum of its parts. It seems to be an unstoppable force. Could it also be a transformative force? Could our global network enable us to tackle some of the world's toughest problems? What challenges do we face in realizing this potential?<br /><br />These are the core questions author Sarah Sorenson tackles in 'The Sustainable Network: The Accidental Answer for a Troubled Planet.' <br /><br />Despite its relative youth, the global network (by which the author means not just the Internet, but all of the connections that link together the planet's computing devices) has already dramatically changed the way humans connect and communicate. Sorenson's message is that this network, 'the only global tool we have,' is also the <em>best</em> tool we've ever had to affect change on a global scale, so we must do what it takes to sustain and nurture it.<br /><br />If you pick this up thinking it's going to be about green technologies because the word 'sustainable' is in the title, you'd be wrong. The network can be a sustainable force in the sense that it connects everybody and everything in the human world, mitigating the need for travel, replacing physical objects with digital products, fostering business across great distances, driving social change, promoting democracy, saving energy, and more. It is, in short, a platform to 'sustain global development, opportunities, and change' &mdash; the connective tissue that allows us to tackle big problems in new ways. The question, then, is can we sustain this network given future challenges like burgeoning global demand, security threats, privacy concerns, and energy demands?<br /><br />Sorenson believes we can, if we're smart about it. Through forty-one chapters sprinkled copiously with real-world examples, facts and figures pulled from various industry reports and news articles, the author outlines what the network is, what it's capable of today, and the pivotal role it could play in coming decades. Here's what she concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>The network is our best chance to set in motion changes that can be shaped to deliver a 21st-century definition of the greater good. It has all the elements: it is pervasive, reaching across the globe and connecting people to information and opportunity; it can reduce our material consumption and conserve precious natural resources; it can make governments accountable to people they serve; it can level the playing field and lower barriers of entry to the entire global marketplace; it can mobilize people so they have a voice; and it can foster collaboration, accelerate innovation, and spur the development of solutions to some of the world's toughest problems.</blockquote>\n<p><br /><br />That's pretty heady stuff, but she makes a good case. Take, for example, net efficiencies. Sorenson details how the network enables technologies such as smart buildings, intelligent transport, and just-in-time supply systems to create efficiencies that could potentially reduce carbon emissions by 15-40 percent. The network also enables individual microloans that improve the lives of tens of thousands of people in the developing world through sites such as Kiva.org. And consider the pivotal role the Internet played in the 2008 U.S. presidential elections; or witness how the network now makes it possible for individuals to deliver boutique products from design to production from the home, all with little to no overhead. The potential and reach of the network to affect change across the spectrum of human interests and activities is truly great.<br /><br />However, the network will only be able to deliver if it continues to grow in a sustainable way. This leads to Sorenson's \"Sustainable Network Law,\" which posits that \"the more broadband made available to network users, the faster sustainable network innovation occurs.\" Makes sense to me. Witness the effect of increasing smart phone usage on 3G network competition. But Sorenson isn't just talking about iPhones here. What she's saying is that user experience derived from better, more robust networks will drive more user demand. This, in turn, will drive more network innovation. This innovation will fuel more user adoption, ad infinitum. It's an interesting point. The concept of a sustainable network may hinge on this holding true. I read this as an industry call to action to get out there and build more network capacity.<br /><br />This leads to the question of who this book was written for. For the most part, the prose seems squarely aimed at a lay audience. For instance, a large portion of the book consists of term and concept definitions, and some of the chapters offer up specific 'steps you can take.' But at times, Sorenson seems to be directing her pen at the industry within which she works as a sustainability consultant. And then there's the blurb on the back cover of 'The Sustainable Network' that says this book is a 'call to action for the individual, governments, markets, and organizations to put the power of this network to good use.' I think that may be a call out to too many groups. While I get the point and largely agree with her, I think Sorenson aims a bit too wide on this front.<br /><br />That said, this book delivers a good overview of what the network is (and its potential going forward) for people like me who are not experts in this area, although at times I felt that Sorenson used a bit too much  'inside baseball' terminology and industry jargon. Yet I couldn't help but get a little swept up in the author's optimism: a sense of the potential of the global network to change our lives. Sure, the obstacles are steep. Sorenson acknowledges this in great detail through several chapters. But the upside is that the network is arguably one of the best tools we've ever had to deal with a wide range of human problems.<br /><br />I enjoyed the read, with a few caveats. For one, the book is sparsely populated with images, many of which look like photocopied screen shots. It would have benefited greatly from full-color images, charts, and graphs to help the reader along. Also, some of the chapters felt less like part of a book and more like a compilation of individual research papers. To be fair, this is in no small part due to the subject matter. Given that the network is a global entity that reaches into almost every facet of our lives, it's surely no easy task to seamlessly cover all aspects of it in 300 pages.<br /><br />Still, what Sorenson has assembled here is a fresh way at looking at a potentially dry topic. I think many authors and pundits tend to look at the world of technology with a dystopian lens, so I was not put off by an optimistic view of where this connective technology could lead. <br /><br />I think the book is empowering in that it raises awareness about the potential of the network, and it emphasizes how we all play a role in harnessing and protecting that power. But for the average reader, I think the greatest strength of the book has more to do with fostering network literacy. That's not a bad thing. I started this book with a sense that I knew quite a lot about the global network, but soon realized I didn't know much at all about it.<br /><br />It's a given these days that computer literacy is no longer just beneficial, it's essential. Perhaps we should think of the global network in the same way. In this sense (whether or not you share Sorenson's vision), 'The Sustainable Network' is a solid read as a primer. You'll walk away knowing a lot more about what we're talking about when we talk about the network.</p>\n<h3>Why did I just review a book?</h3>\n<p><br />In December, O'Reilly Media hosted an interesting promotion on their Facebook page. They offered up free copies of several of their new offerings. For each featured book, the first three people to chime in proclaiming interest in reading that book got a free copy. In return, O'Reilly asked for participants to post a review (not a positive review, just a review) of the book in some online forum. So, you guessed it, I decided it might be fun.</p>\n",

I've grown quite fond of it. Problem is, I'm not ready to buy it. <br /><br />Why? It's expensive. I'm hoping to soon see a promotional discount that drops the price to less than the $25 registration fee. I'm one of many Mailplane fans who think that this retail price is a bit steep. It's a very nice desktop Gmail solution, but is it worth $25?<br /><br />In essence, Mailplane is a polished front-end that provides easy access and some OS integration to Gmail accounts. Many of the reasons that I want to keep using it have more to do with direct access to Gmail features, not with Mailplane features. Perhaps in some other time, I'd just buy it. But I don't want to right now. I'm on a tighter-than-normal budget at the moment. <br /><br />Given this, I was delighted to find that, today, as my 30-day trial expired, I can continue to use Mailplane. <br /><br />The caveat is that many of the integration features that make this tool really shine are now disabled. With an expired trial, it's essentially like a <a href=\"http://fluidapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fluid</a> installation, but it's still quite a lot better. Here's why: <br /><br />I still have access to all of my Gmail accounts from within <strong>one</strong> pane (with Fluid, I'd have to create multiple site specific browsers for each Gmail account); I am still notified of new messages from my multiple Gmail accounts from the menu bar; I still remain logged in to <strong>all</strong> of my Gmail accounts; and I can still keep Mailplane as my default mail application. That last point is key: with Mailplane you can set the app to be your default system-wide mail app. New mail messages created externally from this app are handled with Mailplane, OS-wide. You can't do that with Fluid or other similar browser-based solutions. I assume these privileges are indefinite for unregistered (trial-expired) users. <br /><br />Now that I've passed the end of the trial period, what I lack are extra integration bits that make Mailplane really slick (e.g., ability to drag-and-drop files, resizing photos on the fly, easy capture-and-send screenshots, Address Book integration, iLife media integration, etc.). These features are really nice. I love them. They are handy. However, I think I can do without them for the moment.<br /><br />I'm not advocating that I and others choose to disregard the Mailplane registration fee. The developer surely put in (and continues to put in) lots of hard work developing this mail client. All I'm saying is that I choose to hold out for a promo for a while longer. And I would like to continue to use this mail client to access my Gmail accounts. <br /><br />I'm willing to forego some key features until the next discount comes around (assuming there will be one). It's fortunate, then, that the developer apparently allows for continued use of the app beyond the end of the trial period. It's not fully-featured anymore, but it's still functional. That's classy. <br /><br />Still, I think the registration fee is too expensive. The last promo, on Dec. 12, offered the app for one day at 50% off retail. I think that promo might be much closer to the right target retail price of Mailplane, given the current feature-set.<br /><br />P.S. I'm only one day past my trial period. It may stop working altogether in the morning ...</p>\n",

				"title": "Initial Thoughts of a New iPad 2 User",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I've had an iPad 2 for four days and a Smart Cover for a day and a half. I'm not going to post a detailed review. There have been enough of those. &nbsp;I will, though, share a few initial impressions as a first-time iPad owner.</p>\n<p>First, the Smart Cover.&nbsp;It's remarkable. As remarkable as the iPad. That's no small achievement, and it deserves to win design awards. In case you missed the <a href=\"http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPad-2-Smart-Cover-Teardown/5089/1\">iFixit breakdown of this cover</a>, it's worth your time to check out the magnetic gadgetry that makes this device work. It's easy to use. More, it's a pleasure to use. I love how the iPad instantly turns on when I open the cover. I love the ease with which I can stand my iPad up in two positions.</p>\n<p>It doesn't really clean the glass surface, though. Apple claims that it 'brightens up your iPad.' That's true to an extent. But they also say it 'gently buffs off any smudges or fingerprints as you move, [so your] iPad always looks good on arrival.'&nbsp;That's not quite true. Certainly, the surface looks better than it would without the cover. But the gentle buffing is no substitute for wiping the glass screen with a microfiber cloth. &nbsp;What I've found is that the cover&mdash;as I move it to and fro&mdash;gently removes oily smudges from the surfaces from the areas where the microfiber makes contact. But the microfiber only hits the glass in the ribs of the cover. Between the ribs, in the creases of the cover that allow it to be easily folded up, there is no contact. The oily residue remains in those spaces, appearing as Zebra strips of smudge over the glass surface. It's not a big deal, but it's worth noting that I still need to manually clean the surface.</p>\n<p>Another minor annoyance I have with the cover is that it doesn't magnetically seal when flipped to the back of the device (when I'm using the iPad). It flops around a bit. I imagine that design constraints limit where magnets can be placed within the iPad, and these constraints account for the lack of a magnetic hold when the cover is flipped around to the back of the device. Still, it's not a big deal. It's easy to rip the cover off and toss it aside.</p>\n<p>My final concern regarding the Smart Cover is that it doesn't protect the back of the device. I'm worried about scratching the aluminum. I'm not too worried, though. I trust that third-party vendors will soon offer stick-on protective coatings to address this issue. I'd rather go that route than plunge the iPad in a thick protective case. I don't want the device to be any thicker than it is. I want to hold the thin aluminum back in my hand when I use it. It's an important part of the tactile experience.</p>\n<p>The last thing I have to say about the cover concerns material. I expected that the appearance of the leather model would shame that of the cheaper Polyurethane skin, but found that both models look very nice. In <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/talkshow/32\">5by5's 'The Talk Show' podcast</a>, Dan Benjamin described the surface of the cheaper model akin to the 'Trapper Keeper' plastic those of us of a certain age will surely recall from childhood. It's kind of like that, but it's really much nicer to behold. It's nice enough that I went with a neutral grey polyurethane model and saved some money. I think it looks great.</p>\n<p>As for the iPad 2 itself, I should note that I spent 10 minutes trying out a Motorola Xoom at my local Costco a week ago. This device is, as far as I know, the current 'best of breed' alternative. I thought the Xoom was competent, but it felt choppy and clumsy to the touch. A bit half baked. Now that I have spent considerable time on an iPad 2, I can you assure you that there is no comparison. It's a device that's living up to my childhood expectations of what 21st century tech might be.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Is the iPad 2 perfect? No. There's plenty of room to improve. Is it the best mobile device I've ever used? Yes. Interestingly, a minor change made it more so. Based on a <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/03/13/want-new-gesture-controls-in-ios-4-3-on-your-ipad-heres-how/\">tip I read on TUAW</a>, I upgraded to XCode 4, which allowed me to enable some new multi-gesture devices for the device. These gestures enable rotation through open apps with a gesture, a swipe to see all background apps, and a swipe to get back to the Home screen.</p>\n<p>These seem like minor improvements, but they are not. They make a huge difference in ease of use, akin to how the Smart Cover makes a huge difference by waking up the device when you flip it open. That tiny convenience of auto-waking the device with the Cover vice having to press the 'Home' button makes the iPad that much easier to use. Likewise, these few extra gestures make navigating scores of apps that much more seamless and enjoyable. &nbsp;I hope to see these additional gestures in the next iOS release. As for the fears that these features hint that the Home button is destined for the trash bin, who can say? I don't really care. I prefer to avoid using the Home button if possible.</p>\n<p>My final note concerns the lack of software keyboard support for <a href=\"http://www.dvorak-keyboard.com/\">Dvorak</a>. The lack of the Dvorak layout on my iPhone is no big deal. The screen is too small to accommodate full-handed typing. Not so on the iPad. I suspect I speak for Dvorak-typing Apple enthusiasts everywhere when I say that a software layout option is very important. Without it, we're reduced to hunt-and-peck typing on the iPad screen using an unfamiliar keyboard layout, or we're forced to buy an external keyboard to use iOS hardware Dvorak support. Attention Apple: this is a very simple fix.</p>\n",

While I don't think EagleFiler is as visually appealing as some of the other offerings out there in this genre, I think it more than makes up for it in utility. It is, at heart, a power tool. <br /><br />At first blush, EagleFiler may appear to be little more than an alternative to using the Finder and Spotlight. Like these Apple tools, EagleFiler allows you to store, label, tag, sort, and find documents and media. However, this tool sets itself apart in many useful ways. It's very easy to get your documents into EagleFiler via a system-wide one-click shortcut. It provides an integrated way to more easily manage metadata (tags, labels, notes) for the files you import. It also gives you a place to store items that aren't as easy to manage in the Finder like archived Web pages, important Emails, and notes. And it allows you to create multiple libraries of information so that, for example, you can manage your personal and work files separately.<br /><br /> <a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7c8/1282611958593/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7be/1282611958061/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"EagleFiler Overview\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a> EagleFiler puts all of these tools together in a single, familiar interface that aims to place the focus of your effort where it should be: on doing work with your documents, instead of working to find your documents. I found that it does this job quite well, but it does take some getting used to. While it's easy enough to start using right away, a few trips to the 125-page user manual are necessary to start using it well. Let's start by taking a look at how you get your files into the application.</p>\n<h3>Capturing Data</h3>\n<p><br />EagleFiler captures pretty much anything: documents, images, audio, video, individual emails or entire mailboxes, chat transcripts, bookmarks, text clippings, folders containing multiple items, and more.<br /><br />You can add items in a wide variety of ways. For starters, you can drag any file or folder and drop it on the application window, on the dock icon, or on an optional EagleFiler 'drop pad' that sits on your desktop. You can also add an item by invoking a keyboard shortcut. How do you decide which method to use? It depends on how much you care about where your file goes and if you want to add metadata to the file at the import stage. <br /><br />I don't care for the drop-stuff-right-in-the-app method. I think this method is clumsy and prone to error (i.e. it's easy to drop the file in the wrong place).  It is, however, useful to drag a file to the application window if you want to embed an image, video, text or whatever into an existing rich text document. You just need to remember that this embeds the file in an existing document. It doesn't add the item as a discrete entry in your library.<br /><br /><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7bf/1282611958643/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7c9/1282611958567/1000w\"><img title=\"EagleFiler Import with Options\" src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7c0/1282611958583/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7c1/1282611958052/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"EagleFiler To Import Folder\" width=\"150\" height=\"96\" />There are yet a couple of other ways to enter data. One way we haven't covered is the special 'To Import (Library Name)' folder created by EagleFiler. You'll find this special folder wherever you choose to store your EF files (one per every library you create). This is a special folder in that EagleFiler doesn't need to be running for you to add files. Simply drag stuff in there. The next time you fire up EF, the app will import the items. Per a suggestion in the EF user manual, you can optionally create an alias of this folder in the dock for quick access.  <br /><br />The other way is to right-click on an item and choose the 'EagleFiler: Import' option from the OS X Services drop-down menu. <del>Note that this will only work if you already have an open library</del>.</p>\n<blockquote>From the developer: \"This works whether or not EagleFiler or a library is open. If no library is open, EagleFiler will ask you to open one, and then you can click the Import button to send the file to that library\".</blockquote>\n<p><br /><br />There are clearly plenty of options for importing files and folders. Some might say there are too many options, but I think this is a strength. I spent considerable time on this because it's an important attribute for a tool that is all about capturing and managing files. The tricky part for a new user is finding the method that's most comfortable and sticking with it until its routine. For me, the shortcut key works 95 percent of time. One quibble: when you right-click on a record or one a group of selected records in an EagleFiler window, the drop-down menu includes an option to import to EagleFiler. This should not be there.</p>\n<blockquote>From the developer: \"The 'Services' submenu is added by the OS. As far as I know, it's not editable by the application. You'll see the same thing, e.g. in OmniFocus.\"</blockquote>\n<p><br /><br />If you try to do it, EagleFiler will present you with a pop-up Error window which will tell you it can't import the items because they're already in your library (provided you don't allow duplicates in your library, which is an option in the preferences). I suppose some people may have a need for duplicating items in the library, but most won't. Why would you want to import items to EagleFiler that are already in EagleFiler? A handier option would be to include a right-click shortcut to import an item or items to a <em>different</em> library. <br /><br />Another quibble with the right-click menu, since we're on the topic: it includes a 'Show Info' option, which opens up the Finder's 'Get Info' panel. There is no option to inspect an item or items (modify notes, title, tags) from this menu, and there should be. The only way I could find to get to the inspector for an item already in the library is by clicking on a button in the Toolbar. Given that you'll more likely need to add or change labels, tags, notes, or a title for an item more than you need to view the item's Finder's info, it seems like a glaring omission that this choice is not presented in the right-click menu. Perhaps many users will choose to always leave the inspector window open. I prefer to open it only when I need it.</p>\n<blockquote>From the developer: \"Thanks for the suggestion. You can also open the Info inspector from the Window menu or using the keyboard shortcut. Again, the contents of the Services menu are added by the OS, so it's not as if I'm choosing to put the Finder's Info command in the menu instead of EagleFiler's.\"</blockquote>\n<p><br /><br /> <a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7ca/1282611958657/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7c2/1282611958557/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"EagleFiler Note Tools\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a> So far, we've only talked about importing preexisting data. EagleFiler is also a handy note creation tool. You can create new RTF files at will and, as I mentioned previously, embed items such as images or audio in an RTF document. The rich text editor included in EagleFiler meets all of the basic formatting needs for a simple document, including a variety of styles, spacing, and (handily) outlining options. While you won't find special note-taking items in EF (here I'm thinking about Yojimbo, which includes special forms to add serial numbers and passwords), I didn't miss these extras. EF is flexible enough to add whatever you want in a note. If you want to store passwords and serials, there are better tools for the job (1Password).</p>\n<blockquote>From the developer: \"EagleFiler doesn't have built-in special note-taking forms, but you can add your own using the <a href=\"http://c-command.com/eaglefiler/manual-ah/new-record-open-stati\">stationery feature</a>.</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organizing, Finding, Modifying Files</h3>\n<p><br />Now let's take a look at how you work with documents in EagleFiler. The first thing to highlight is that you aren't locked into dumping all of your data in one giant database (called a 'Library' in EagleFiler). While you may prefer to keep it simple and maintain one library, you're free to create as many as you wish. I've created one for personal items and one for work. This alone is a big organizational boost from that of the Finder. You can even keep multiple libraries simultaneously open so you can ferry files to the repository of your choice.<br /><br />With a given library, you'll note that the interface is much like that of Apple Mail. There's a left column in which you are presented with different ways of sorting through your data. And there's a right column in which you see a list of your selected documents. Underneath this list is the familiar preview of the currently selected item. <br /><br /> <a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7cb/1282611958703/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7c3/1282611958677/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"EagleFiler File Organization\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a> Organizing files is a simple endeavor. You may create static folders and drop items in those folders. Or you may create rule-based smart folders to filter all of the records in your library based on criteria of your choice. Lastly, you can tag your files. As you add tags, the tag list in the left column will automatically update.<br /><br />To search for particular items or items, use the keyword search pane at the top of the app window (just like Spotlight, only faster), or use filter out what you want using your user-created smart folders or tags. EagleFiler includes some built-in smart folders (Recently Added, Recently Modified, and Untagged) and tags (flagged, note, unread, as well as some additional mail-specific tags). This is a nice touch, but you can't modify these. I see no reason why the built-in tags and folders should not be user-editable. I also couldn't find the option to add icons to user-created tags (perhaps the developer could include a small library of additional icons from which I could choose, or allow user-created icons to be pasted in). The visual cues these little icons provide are handy, evidenced by Yojimbo's smart folder icons for photos, web archives, bookmarks, and archives.</p>\n<blockquote>From the developer: \"You can edit the colors and abbreviation symbols for the built-in tags. The names are not editable because these tags have special meaning within EagleFiler. If you could change the names, there would be all sorts of issues importing from other applications, moving files from other libraries, restoring from backups, etc. You can edit the abbreviation symbols by choosing Window &gt; Show Tags. They are text (Unicode characters) so pasting images is not supported. Click the Characters button to access the available symbols (You can also type regular letters on the keyboard).\"</blockquote>\n<p><br /><br />The tagging power of the app is a great strength, but it could be better. You can tag an item manually, or you can drag it to an existing tag folder to have the item adopt that tag. Once you enter a tag, EagleFiler will remember it and attempt to auto-complete your word with future entries. It works well, but there's one thing that bugs me. If you're used to the tagging functions in a program like Things, you'll notice that tag sorting in EagleFiler doesn't work the same way. In Things, if you shift-select multiple tags you are presented with only those items that meet all conditions (e.g., which items are tagged with both 'tag1' AND 'tag2'). In EagleFiler, shift-selecting multiple tags shows you all items that use the selected tags ('tag1' OR 'tag2'). I think the way Things handles tags makes more sense &mdash; it's why most people would select more than one tag, right? <del>I'd also love to see EagleFiler add the ability to create hierarchical (nested) tags as one can using Things</del>. <em>NOTE: You can create nested tags. See below. </em></p>\n<blockquote>From the developer: \"EagleFiler is going for consistency with other applications like Mail, where selecting more than one source shows the union. I'm considering making it an option to show the intersection, but it's not totally clear how it should work. What if you select two folders? Or a folder and a tag? You can create a tag hierarchy using drag and drop. Or select a tag and click \"+\" or choose \"New Tag\" to make a new child tag.\"</blockquote>\n<p><br /> <br />Now on to file modification. Let's start with batch change &mdash; useful if, say, you want to add a tag to thirty documents at once. There are several ways to get this done. It works with a key combo (shift + command + B) or by going to the menu bar and selecting Records &gt; Batch Change. A 'batch change' button also automatically appears on the bottom shelf of the app window if you have multiple items selected. This is usually the way I access this function. The only thing missing is for the developer to add a quick-link icon for batch changes to the Toolbar (as a customization option), but I don't think most people will miss not having it there. <br /><br /> <a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7cc/1282611958747/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7c4/1282611958727/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"EagleFiler File Encryption\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a> The way EagleFiler handles encryption may be of concern to some users. Unlike Yojimbo, which allows per-item encryption, EagleFiler only allows you to encrypt your files at the library level. You either encrypt your entire library, or nothing. I'd like the option to encrypt individual files, but as I understand it, this is a trade-off for having files stored outside of a database (see next section for more on file storage). Having said that, library encryption is a handy way to store libraries on a thumb drive or in Dropbox to access elsewhere, as everything is self-contained in the secure disk image. Once I got used to, I started to appreciate it.</p>\n<blockquote>Note from the developer: \"I think per-item encryption should be of concern because (1) The index is unencrypted. So either your data is exposed or the encrypted items can't be indexed for searching; and (2) If you import an item and then later make it encrypted, the unencrypted data may still be stored on the disk. So I think it's simpler and safer to encrypt at the library level.\"</blockquote>\n<p><br /><br />Finally, a few words about modifying files <em>within</em> and <em>outside</em> of EagleFiler. While it's easy to edit your documents in external programs by double-clicking on or right-clicking on an item and choosing the 'Open With' command (defaults are taken from your Mac OS 'Open With' preferences), you need to let EagleFiler know you changed a file externally if you want the program to be able to monitor the health of your files. Without getting into too much detail, if you only ever use EagleFiler to manage and modify your  files, then you don't need to worry about this. If you aren't worried about maintaining the long-term integrity of your files, then you don't need to worry about this. <br /><br /> <a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7cd/1282611958079/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7c5/1282611958767/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\" File Verify and Update Checksum\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a> If you do want to maintain the ability to monitor the integrity of your files and to accurately check for duplicate files, you need to use the 'Update Checksum' command every time you modify a file outside of EF to let it know you did so. A checksum, non-technically speaking, is a way to digitally check if a file has errors. If you don't manually update the checksum on your files that you externally edit, EagleFiler has no way of knowing if the changes in the file were legit or if the changes indicate corruption. If you do keep your files updated in this manner, you can periodically check your files using 'Verify' to see if everything is OK. <br /><br />It's not a show-stopper if you don't do this, just know that if you don't, the app has no way to detect problems with your files. I think it's worth the effort. I do, though, think that EagleFiler could help us out a little more here. While you can add 'Update Checksum' and 'Verify' to the Toolbar, these items are not there by default. Another option might be for the program to display a pop-up reminder when you save back an externally edited file to remind you to update the checksum (or, better yet, a pop-up with a button to update the checksum as you save it back to the library). The checksum and verify tools are an important way to keep your files healthy for the long-term, and I think the developer could do a better job at making this easier to do.</p>\n<blockquote>From the developer: \"Agreed. I definitely need to make it easier for people to use checksums and still edit from other apps.\"</blockquote>\n<p><br /><br />As it is now, I'd wager most users never use these features. That's a shame, because it's one of the features that make EagleFiler stand out. By the way, this is something that you wouldn't have to worry about if all of your files were stored in an enclosed database (like Yojimbo does).</p>\n<blockquote>From the developer: \"With a database, all the access to the data would go through the app, so theoretically it could update the checksums automatically (with the tradeoff that it's impossible to modify the files with another app). But, as far as I know, none of the database apps actually do this; they have no way to check the data integrity at all.\"</blockquote>\n<p><br /><br />There are trade-offs for having your files stored externally, which we'll talk about next.</p>\n<h3>How Your Files are Stored</h3>\n<p><br /><br />It's always a good idea to have a basic understanding of how a given app handles your data, especially when you are entrusting your most important files to said app. Many info management tools on the market store all of your data in a database. While this isn't usually a problem, it can be an issue down the road if it's not properly managed. With EagleFiler, only a small OS X Core Data SQL database is used for each library to keep track of metadata such as what types of files you have, where the files are, and when you added or changed the files. The files, however, are not stored in a database. They exist in an open format, right in the Finder. <br /><br /> <a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7ce/1282611958817/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7c6/1282611958803/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\" EagleFiler File Storage\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a> This means that's there's no need to worry about exporting items from a database down the road, because there is no database to worry about. There's also no need to worry about losing carefully crafted metadata should you stop using this tool, as it's all saved with the file in Spotlight-friendly format. And you don't need to worry as much about database corruption. Even if your EagleFiler database gets corrupted, is accidentally deleted, or is destroyed, your files will still be sitting there in your Finder, complete with metadata in tact. I like this. While I wouldn't hesitate to collect all of the documents on my system within EagleFiler, I wouldn't want to collect all of my documents in a program that stored them in an enclosed database.<br /><br />An important caveat: while your files are in plain view and may be manipulated outside of the program via the Finder, don't do it unless you've stopped using the program. This sort of file system is immensely appealing because your files are not locked up in a database. It means that you can stop using the app at any time without worrying about exporting your stuff. However, while you are using EagleFiler, remember that it's doing the job of monitoring and managing these files. If you <del>modify or move things around</del> add, delete, or move files in the Finder, EagleFiler will no longer be able to properly do that job for you.<br /><br />If you choose to encrypt a library, your files are stored a bit differently. They're placed in a password-protected sparse image bundle. What you need to know is that this file must be opened and your password entered to view the protected library. Once you open up it up, a disk image mounts on the desktop. All of your files reside inside this image. To close this library, you must close the library in EagleFiler, then eject the disk image on your desktop. I don't have any issues with this, but I will say that it's not very elegant and may put some people off. It's annoying that the encrypted file only shows up in EagleFiler's 'open recent' menu item when it's opened. If it's closed, you'll have to find it in the Finder or search for it in Spotlight. To make it easier to work with an encrypted library, I found it's easiest to create a shortcut to the sparse image (in the dock or on the desktop).</p>\n<blockquote>It's worth noting that <a href=\"http://c-command.com/eaglefiler/manual-ah/how-can-i-access-my-lib\" target=\"_blank\">you can store files for EagleFiler in your Dropbox or SugarSync account</a> to access your files from multiple Macs. There's an important caveat, though: if you use file color labels or custom icons, those items will be lost using these services because the services don't fully support Mac files. However, you can create an encrypted library for use on these services that will maintain all of your metadata (as it stores your files in an encrypted self-contained disk image).</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Verdict</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>1. Could I figure out how to use the app with minimal fuss (w/o documentation)?</h4>\n<p><br />I could figure out the basic functions of the program, but I didn't really get what it could do until I read the documentation. It's quite a powerful tool, but only if you slog through some of the documentation. If you're going to invest in the app and entrust it to managing your files, it pays to get to know it well. If you're looking for a light manager to store snippets and occasional documents, it may be more power than you need. It's a solid choice, though, if you're looking for an app to take over the management of most (if not all) of the documents in your digital life.</p>\n<h4>2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the app after several weeks of use?</h4>\n<p><br />I've just completed my 30-day trial, and I've grown enthusiastic to the point of dependancy. That speaks well for EagleFiler. I would say this app gave me much better focus into my documents, something that the Finder lacks. It also provided me with the basic note-taking/storage needs that I enjoyed while using Yojimbo. Finally, because the database is only storing metadata, it's a light-weight program in terms of CPU usage. I have no issues with leaving it running all the time. That made it easy to start using it as my central file repository. While it fully meets my file organizer needs, it only met some of my note-taking needs. That isn't necessarily a criticism. What I'm saying is that I have other solutions to meet my snippet storage needs (<a href=\"http://selfcoded.com/JustNotes/\" target=\"_blank\">JustNotes</a> for non-sensitive notes (a free program that syncs with <a href=\"http://simplenoteapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Simplenote</a> on my iPhone), and <a href=\"http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password\" target=\"_blank\">1Password</a> (a popular paid app that stores my sensitive notes, passwords). For those notes that I don't store in JustNotes or 1Password, EagleFiler does the job.</p>\n<h4>3. How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?</h4>\n<p><br />Quite well. As evidenced in the section on entering data, there are many ways to get things done with this app. My one complaint is that some of the EagleFiler commands (inspect, verify, checksum) could be better integrated within the application.</p>\n<h4>4. How did it feel?</h4>\n<p><br />For users of Apple Mail and a host of other Apple and third-party apps built in OS X, the layout and basic functions of EagleFiler will be immediately familiar. From a visual perspective, I'm underwhelmed by the application and tag iconography employed by EagleFiler. It's a minor point, but making these icons a bit more stylish might make this app feel a bit friendlier and more accessible. Compare the look and feel of EF with Yojimbo and you'll see what I mean. Looks are important. I'm not asking for eye candy. Rather, I'm asking for a more elegance in appearance to help inspire users to dive into this powerful application.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p><br /><br />How does EagleFiler fit on the triangle? I'd say it's about 75% file organizer; 20% notebook; 5% visualizer<br /><br /><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7c7/1282611958062/#img.jpg1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"EagleFiler Triangle Plot\" width=\"520\" height=\"255\" /><br /><br /><br />The file organizer and notebook percentages are fairly obvious, but you may wonder why I gave it 5% visualization. It's because it can be used to manage and organize projects within a library or in multiple libraries; its note-taking capabilities include support for outlining; and a good system of smart folders and tags can be a real handy tool to not only organize your files and notes, but to see how they fit together. As a file manager and note organizer EagleFiler works impressively as advertised. There are plenty of choices out there, though, if you're looking for a more powerful visualization tool.<br /><br />I didn't hit on all of the features of this app, but hopefully hit the highlights. EagleFiler is a compelling alternative to the Finder for organizing files, and a competent note-taking tool. Is it worth the $30 price of admission? I think it is, but only if you take the time to learn how to use it. While it's not necessary to read the entire 125-page user manual that ships with the software, it is necessary to peruse the first few chapters to understand how to tap into some key features. Those features are what transform EF from a simple Finder alternative into a tool that can help to make your information better perform for you. <br /><br />EagleFiler offers a 30-day trial.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>It's time to (re)start the Mac information manager series, a project I began a year and a half ago. I now (finally!) have the time to dedicate some time to this. What follows is a brief synopsis of what I've already written about, presented so that it's not necessary to refer back to older posts. I also set the stage for where I intend to go with the series from this point forward.<br /><br />Here, then, is a recap:<br /><br />You may be familiar with the archaic acronym PIM (Personal Information Manager).  As I said in a previous post, I think this term is hopelessly broad and meaningless. Every program used on a home computer is, in a sense, a personal info manager. For the purpose of these reviews, then, I've decided to ditch PIM. I'm adopting a new acronym I'll call MIP (Making Info Perform). It's a bit cheesy, but I think MIP better captures a certain spirit of the myriad info management solutions out there today: the promise is to not only harness the chaos that is your data, but to feed it back to you with ease, and in ways that foster insight and creativity. That's what I expect out of my info management tools, at any rate.<br /><br />Such tools are increasingly necessary to manage the flood of text, documents, PDFs, images, bookmarks, emails, multimedia files, snippets, and notes that comprise our digital life. The good news: there are many solid productivity and organization applications for the Mac to help reduce your clutter, most of which offer ample free trial periods. The bad news: they all claim to be the perfect solution for organizing your mess of information. Which app to choose?<br /><br />That's what I'm trying to answer here by taking a thorough look at a selection of some of the more popular Mac-based info managers. Personally, it's a good time for me to tackle this. While I've used Yojimbo for several years, I'm not sure it's the app I want to stick with. Since Yojimbo recently released version 2 of the app (requiring a $20 upgrade fee), I want to better understand my alternatives before paying out.<br /><br />If you're familiar with the backstory to this series, you know that I've struggled with identifying which apps to include. Now I've nailed down the list to include <a href=\"http://c-command.com/eaglefiler/\" target=\"_blank\">EagleFiler</a>, <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/Yojimbo/\" target=\"_blank\">Yojimbo</a>, <a href=\"http://reinventedsoftware.com/together/\" target=\"_blank\">Together</a>, <a href=\"http://www.chronosnet.com/Products/sohonotes.html\" target=\"_blank\">SOHO Notes</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.circusponies.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Circus Ponies Notebook</a>. My selection criteria is based on several factors: personal interest, popularity in the Mac community, and reader feedback from the early days of this series. As I already covered Yojimbo when I began this series, I'm not going to review it again in full. Instead, I'll present a short update to reflect what's new and notable in version 2. I recognize that this is not a complete list, but it's a decent cross-section.<br /><br />A key challenge I've faced in preparing to review these apps is one of classification. These tools do many different things, but they have common elements. One goal of this project is to find a way to tie them all together in some sort of framework. I think I now have a decent working model. When we last left off (a <a href=\"/2008/10/the-spectrum-of-pim/\" target=\"_blank\">long</a> time ago), I proposed that information managers for the Mac generally fall in three main categories:</p>\n<h3>Finders</h3>\n<p>These applications strive to serve up something better than Apple&rsquo;s Finder to archive, organize, and search through your important documents. Apps in this category tend to focus on giving you powerful metadata tools to help you find what you need and organize your existing documents/files. Examples are Leap, PathFinder, EagleFiler, Together, DEVONThink.</p>\n<h3>Creators</h3>\n<p>These apps focus on providing a better notebook experience. They provide a central repository to create and collect notes, ideas, snippets, multimedia clips, and (to a lesser extent) existing documents. Simple interfaces, quick entry, and rapid search are emphasized. Examples are Yojimbo, Evernote, Notebook, VooDooPad</p>\n<h3>Visualizers</h3>\n<p>These applications focus on providing a better creative space in which to help you plan projects, discover relationships, and gain insight into your data. Examples are Curio, Tinderbox, OmniOutliner.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a name=\"triangle\"></a><br />How do we tie these categories together? I originally tried placing the categories on a linear spectrum, but several readers pointed out that a triangle plot would be more apropos. I have to agree (for the backstory on this, read the comments of the <a href=\"/2008/10/the-spectrum-of-pim/\" target=\"_blank\">Spectrum of PIM</a> post). So here's the triangle, in all its glory:<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7b5/1282611958507/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7b6/1282611958473/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"info manager triangle\" width=\"520\" height=\"343\" /><br /><br />The idea behind the triangle is that there&rsquo;s a lot of overlap in function between the various info management tools out there, so this plot is a way to show where an app falls in terms of utility as a file organizer (F=Find), note creator (C=Create), or visualizer (V=Visualize). The corners of the triangle represent 100% Finder (bottom left point), 100% Creator (top point), and 100% Visualizer (bottom right point). The farther you get away from any one of these points,  the lower the percentage for a given category.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with how to read this sort of plot, it's easiest to see how it works by way of example. And since this isn't an exact science, I'll employ a simpler version of the triangle for my reviews. Here's what the triangle plot looks like <em>sans</em> percentage lines for EagleFiler, as an example:<br /><br /><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc7b7/1282611958062/#img.jpg1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"EagleFiler Triangle Plot\" width=\"520\" height=\"255\" /><br /><br />I place EagleFiler at a location that represents about 75% file organizer, 20% notebook, and 5% visualization tool. Make sense? <br /><br />I&rsquo;ve included Visualizers in this model based on the recognition that is an important sub-category of the genre, but I've decided to limit my reviews to tools that fall more in the finder and creator categories. Still, it's useful to include visualizers for two reasons. First, some of finder/creator focused-apps have functions that fall within the visualization realm. Second, some of the visualizing tools on the market include note-taking and file organizational features. My hope is that the triangle will, at a minimum, provide a handy way to <em>think</em> about any given info management tool (even if that app isn't covered in this particular series, and even if you don't agree with my where I place a particular app). In other words, this framework hopefully accommodates all or most of the apps that fall within the broader 'information manager' category.<br /><br />OK. That's enough about the triangle. <br /><br />In closing, I want to reemphasize a few points I previously made to set the stage for the resumption of these reviews: some of these tools focus on organization, some on creating new info, and some focus most on tying together all stuff into some sort of coherent package so we can find our way forward. There aren&rsquo;t necessarily clear winners that do it all. Our challenge is to pick the right apps to do the job in a way that is natural for us. It may mean using more than one info management tool. <br /><br />The question, then, is how do these various organizers measure up? I'll be looking at the aforementioned apps with a focus on answering the following questions:<br /><br /><strong>1. Could I figure out how to use the application with minimal fuss (preferably without referring to documentation)?<br />2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?<br />3. How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?<br />4. How well could I manage all of my tasks (work, home, play, etc.)<br />5. How did the program &lsquo;feel?&rsquo; How &lsquo;mac-like&rsquo; is it?</strong><br /><br />Now on to the reviews. <br /></p>\n",

				"title": "The DNS choice",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Last week, the tech world was abuzz with the launch of Google's new public Domain Name System (DNS) resolution service. <br /><br />Since I posted <a href=\"/2008/12/opendns-dyndns-dns-o-matic/\" target=\"_blank\">a while back</a> about OpenDNS, I thought I'd share my thoughts on this subject. The main question I set out to answer is whether or not I should switch from OpenDNS to Google's Public DNS? <br /><br />As I began this experiment, my most important criteria was speed. Which service offers the fastest browsing experience? To answer that, I searched around and discovered this helpful post on <a href=\"http://www.manu-j.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">TechSutra</a> &mdash; <a href=\"http://www.manu-j.com/blog/opendns-alternative-google-dns-rocks/403/\" target=\"_blank\">Google DNS vs OpenDNS: Google Rocks for International Users</a>.<br /><br />One of the readers over at TechSutra (Stevan Bajiƒá) wrote the following bash script to test out the speed of four popular alternative DNS services. To use this script, run this in terminal (you can enter any domains you want here): <br /><br /><code> </code></p>\n<p><code>\n<pre><br />#!/bin/sh<br />isp=$(dig +noall +stats 2&gt;&amp;1 | awk '$2~/^SERVER:$/{split($3,dnsip,\"#\");print dnsip[1]}');<br />m=\"-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\";<br />s=\"                                                                               \";<br />h=\"+${m:0:25}+${m:0:12}+${m:0:12}+${m:0:12}+${m:0:12}+${m:0:12}+\";<br />header=(\"Domain${s:0:23}\" \"Your ISP${s:0:10}\" \"Google${s:0:10}\" \"4.2.2.2${s:0:10}\" \"OpenDNS${s:0:10}\" \"DNS Adv.${s:0:10}\");<br />echo \"${h}\";<br />echo \"| ${header[0]:0:23} | ${header[1]:0:10} | ${header[2]:0:10} | ${header[3]:0:10} | ${header[4]:0:10} | ${header[5]:0:10} |\";<br />echo \"${h}\";<br />for i in \"lifehacker.com\" \"facebook.com\" \"viewfromthedock.com\"  \"reddit.com\" \"tb4.fr\" \"bbc.co.uk\";<br />do<br />  ii=\"${i}${s:23}\";<br />  echo -ne \"| ${ii:0:23} |\";<br />  for j in \"${isp}\"  \"8.8.8.8\"  \"4.2.2.2\" \"208.67.222.222\" \"156.154.70.1\";<br />  do<br />    r=\"${s:10}$(dig +noall +stats +time=9 @${j} ${i} 2&gt;&amp;1 | awk '$2~/^Query$/{print $4\" \"$5}')\";<br />    echo -ne \" ${r:${#r}-10} |\";<br />  done<br />  echo -ne \"n${h}n\";<br />done</pre>\n</code><br /><br />I ran tests at different times of the day, and on different days. For me, OpenDNS and Google were consistently fast. Results for Level3, DNS Advantage, and my ISP varied widely (sometimes I'd get decent results, sometimes response times were abysmal). <br /><br />While the results I received from Google and OpenDNS were best, the difference in speed between the two was negligible. We're talking milliseconds here, after all. I don't think I'm really going to notice the difference between a response time of, say, 11 ms and 13ms (although research indicates that <a href=\"http://kottke.org/09/12/google-dns\" target=\"_blank\">milliseconds <em>do</em> makes a difference</a>).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>One think to keep in mind is that the initial test you perform may return slower results than subsequent tests for some obscure sites. The first time you search for <a href=\"http://www.threetastes.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.threetastes.com</a>, for example, (my wife's blog) the DNS service will likely have to go out and get this IP address from an authoritative server. After that first lookup, the IP will be cached with the DNS server, so the response time will be quicker for subsequent tests. In short, run multiple tests.</blockquote>\n<p><br /><br /><br /><br />My results jibe with <a href=\"http://www.manu-j.com/blog/opendns-vs-google-dns-which-is-better/405/\" target=\"_blank\">those</a> coming in from readers at TechSutra: that OpenDNS may have a slight edge for many U.S. locations, while Google DNS may have the edge for users outside of the U.S. Best to test it out the alternatives for yourself.<br /><br />So, I've established that Google DNS and OpenDNS offer comparably faster DNS lookups compared to my ISP. Both services also offer security features to make browsing safer (my ISP may have these features, but I have no way of knowing what's going as these details aren't published. I have greater confidence that Google and OpenDNS DNS servers are not and will not be compromised). <br /><br />Now, which to choose?</p>\n<h3>1. Do I want to use yet another Google service?</h3>\n<p>I'm not too worried about this. Google <a href=\"http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/privacy.html\" target=\"_blank\">privacy policy</a> is very clear. I've experienced no cause for concern with my Google services.</p>\n<h3>2. Do I have a problem with the way OpenDNS operates?</h3>\n<p>When I began this comparison, the answer was 'not really.' After pondering this for a while, I have to say I do have a problem. With OpenDNS, if you type in a domain that does not exist, you are redirected to an OpenDNS ad-based search page. This is bad behavior.  I knew this already, but I didn't worry about. I turned off NX Domain redirection in my OpenDNS user settings. Here's the part that annoys me: OpenDNS describes this feature as 'typo correction,' but say nothing about how this is tied to redirection to their own ad page if the domain can't be resolved. They should take a cue from Google and explain this more clearly. Sure, this service corrects typos (changes .cmo to .com, for example), but this is only a minor feature of a service that's really about generating revenue from the mistakes people make in entering URLs. In addition, when you perform a Google Search using OpenDNS, your request is redirected to an OpenDNS server before going to Google by default. This may also be turned off (by unchecking 'Enable OpenDNS Proxy') but it's not really clear how to do it. And let's face it, most users aren't going to mess with OpenDNS advanced settings. Lastly, you must have BOTH 'Enable OpenDNS Proxy' and 'Typo Correction' turned on to enjoy the benefits of OpenDNS' content filtering features (one of the big reasons people like OpenDNS). <br /><br />Here's the bottom line: OpenDNS offers a fast DNS service that includes many<a href=\"http://www.opendns.com/start/\" target=\"_blank\"> extra free or pay features</a>. It's a good option if you need those extra features and aren't worried about the way the service handles your requests. The main gripe I have with OpenDNS is that they are not transparent about how they're doing business. Google, on the other hand, offers a fast DNS service and reliable security features. It's a good option if you don't need extra bells and whistles. <br /><br />Think I'll switch over to Google DNS.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>So you decide to buy a copy of <a href=\"http://culturedcode.com/things/\" target=\"_blank\">Things</a> from Cultured Code. You've read great things about it (no pun intended), and you're ready to graduate from chaotic analog scratchings on a notepad to an elegant digital management process using an award-winning application. <br /><br />Impatient, you give the instructions a cursory glance, then begin madly entering tasks. A week later, you note that most of the items you dumped in the inbox during the first week are overdue. Your initial enthusiasm wanes. You want to use this app, but old habits die hard. With a tinge of guilt, you keep reverting to writing down your tasks on a notepad.  <br /><br />One day, you decide to give it another go. You paid for this app, after all. Months go by. In time, you learn just enough (largely through trial-and-error) to use Things as a basic task management tool. Habits are formed. You know how to add new task items, create projects, set due dates, and tag your items. But your list is still chaotic. Your tags are haphazard. You start a project, then abandon it. You tend to stick all of your tasks in the inbox and leave them there. While you've made the switch to digital task management, you know that you're not taking advantage of the power under the hood. You <em>know</em> that&mdash;if you took the time to really grok this app&mdash;you'd be more productive. <br /><br />Like many of the other Mac apps you've purchased, Things is a tool you want to learn how to use in the way it was intended to be used&mdash;but time is at a premium. And, let's be honest, you just aren't going to take the time to read the documentation.<br /><br />Enter the screencast. For many people, it's hard to really get how to use an app by reading written instructions. It's much easier (and more enjoyable) to watch a video demonstration. <br /><br /><a title=\"ScreenCastsOnline\" href=\"http://www.screencastsonline.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc79c/1282611901283/#img.jpg.com/index_files/SCO0221-thingspt3.php\" target=\"_blank\">series of high-quality videos</a> that teach you how to deploy your purchase. These videos are available at <a href=\"http://www.screencastsonline.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ScreenCastsOnline</a>, a one-man show run out of the UK offering high-quality video productions that illustrate how to use the Mac OS and a variety of popular Mac software titles. <br /><br />If you don't want to or can't afford to subscribe to this service, you'll still find excellent free tutorials here. And if you're willing to invest a modest amount of cash to learn how to better use your apps and operating system, now is the time to grab a membership. This month, ScreenCastsOnline is offering a 50 percent discount. At $57 for a six-month membership, this a good deal. You get <a href=\"http://www.screencastsonline.com/sco_extra/extrasub.html\" target=\"_blank\">a lot</a> for your money. <br /><br />Disclaimer: I don't subscribe to ScreenCastsOnline, and I'm not sponsored by this operation in any way. But I've viewed many SCO videos and have found that they are uniformly outstanding. Take a look at some of the many free screencasts on offer and decide for yourself. I say that if you're going to pay for a Mac application, it's in your interest to learn how to use it well. I think this is one of the best ways to do this.<br /><br /><a title=\"Lynda.com\" href=\"http://www.lynda.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc79d/1282611901257/#img.jpg\" width=\"215\" height=\"114\" /></a>Another solid option is <a href=\"http://www.lynda.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lynda.com</a>. The reason I don't subscribe to ScreenCastsOnline is that I'm fortunate enough to enjoy unlimited access to Lynda through my employer, so my plate is full. This site offers a huge selection of tutorials, enough to keep me occupied for years. If you are in the business of web development, graphic design, video work, photography, audio production, or Flash development, you'll get a lot out of these tutorials. <br /><br />Here's the difference between the two: SCO is consumer-focused and Mac-centric. Lynda.com is geared towards corporate users who have employees on a variety of platforms with specialized needs. SCO focuses on Mac-specific OS and app tutorials that meet the needs of most Mac users. Lynda.com focuses on professional development and training for higher-end applications/tools like the Adobe Creative Suite or Final Cut Studio. An advantage of SCO is that you can download tutorials and keep them forever. There's no DRM. With Lynda.com, tutorials are online-only. For personal training on the Mac, SCO is the way to go. For professional training, steer to Lynda (and you may want to consider pitching Lynda to your employer. Compared to on-site training courses, it's dirt cheap).<br /><br /><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc79e/1282611901021/#img.jpg/\" target=\"_blank\">alternativeto.net</a> and <a href=\"http://osx.iusethis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">iusethis.com</a>. <br /><br /><em>AlternativeTo</em> is the newer of the two sites, and I really like the approach they're taking. Pick a product (Mac, Windows, Linux, online) and see a user-generated lists of alternatives to that product. There are 15 alternatives to Photoshop for the Mac, for example. While all the alternatives are not necessarily equals to a given app, it at least provides a wide angle shot of what's available. I use it as an exploratory tool to find out about applications I've never heard of before.<br /><br />The other site, <em>iusethis</em>, is similar. You can look up an app (Mac, iPhone, Windows) to get an idea of how many people use it, to include viewing random user comments of varying merit. As with <em>AlternativeTo</em>, it's easy to link to related apps to explore other solutions. This site is best for taking a quick snapshot of the relative popularity of a given app, what some people are saying about it, and for exploring the most popular apps (according to the self-selected user base of iusethis) in a given category. It's the site I use to get a ballpark estimation of what users think of a given application.</p>\n",

				"title": "VMWare 3: Good Product, Terrible Ordering Process",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Here is an example of a confusing, muddled online purchasing experience. <br /><br />It began well enough. I decided to upgrade to the latest version of <a href=\"http://www.vmware.com/vmwarestore/fusion-for-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">VMWare Fusion 3</a> prior to installing Windows 7 on my Mac. I had heard that VMWare's virtualization offered faster boot times, better integration with the Mac OS, and best-in-class support for the 64-bit version of Windows 7. I started my journey by reading up on the new features on the VMWare site. Then I read about what would be included with my purchase: <br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc790/1282611901307/#img.png.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc791/1282611901323/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"VMWare Fusion step 2\" width=\"520\" height=\"206\" /><br /><br />I hesitated. Did I really need to pay $20 more? Was this indicating that VMWare intends to release version 4.0 within the next 12 months? Are they saying that, with the basic $40 upgrade fee, I can expect to pay $40 <em>again</em> within a year for version 4? And that paying $20 now will save me $20 <em>down the road</em>? That might be worth it, but I didn't have enough information to make the decision. Who knows? They aren't telling. They just throw it out there that it may be a good idea to 'protect your investment.' Nothing explicit is stated. In the absence of clarity, I decided to go with the simple $40 upgrade. I reasoned that the last point upgrade occurred more than 12 months ago, so I'm probably OK with the basic upgrade. I imagine many a consumer will opt for the 'protect your investment' path. I hope it works out for them. VMWare should more explicitly state what this 'protection' offers. As is, it seems like a cheesy ploy to make some extra cash.<br /><br />On to the next step. Next, I'm presented with options to 'add functionality' to my selection.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc792/1282611901347/#img.png1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"VMWare Fusion step 3\" width=\"520\" height=\"209\" /><br /><br />This step in the ordering process is particularly frustrating. It's also devious. For $30 more, I could choose per-incident email support for one incident per year. By clicking on the link for this option, I received an explanatory pop-up message indicating that this would afford me email/phone support from a Technical Support Engineer. I would also get 'documentation, Knowledge Base articles and discussion forums through the VMware web site.'  <br /><br />Do I need this? I don't think so. I had just read on the previous page that my $40 upgrade fee <strong>comes with 18 months of free email support</strong>. And documentation, forums, and Knowledge Base articles are <strong>complimentary</strong> for all registered users of VMWare Fusion. So what does this 'added functionality' get you? Nothing that you probably couldn't figure out from the forums. And if you do need to send an email to VMWare to get help, you can do so without spending extra money. They claim target response times within 24 hours for all severity of problems. That's pretty good free support. <br /><br />I say this step in the ordering process is <em>devious</em> because it's poorly explained, and I think deliberately so. The explanatory pop-up window is vague, and there's no link anywhere to the <a href=\"http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/support.html\" target=\"_blank\">VMWare Support Options page</a>, where all of this is explained in much greater detail (I tried to get there by choosing a 'Support' link located at the top of the 'Customize Your Order' page, but I was taken to a page entitled 'Buy VMWare Support.' Here, I was presented with yet another offer to purchase per-incident support). <br /><br />Last point: the design of this page is such that the 'Add to Cart' button is clear and obvious, but the 'No Thanks - Proceed to Checkout' link is small and unobtrusive. I've seen this sort of thing in many places around the Web, as I'm sure you have. It's a subtlety designed to get people to spend more money, simply because many people aren't paying attention. This sort of thing is not customer friendly. It's customer hostile. <br /><br />At any rate, I moved on. After I made my purchase, I was directed to a download page. Here, I was presented with yet another confusing choice: do I want to download the full or the light version? <br /><br /><img src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc793/1282611901187/#img.png.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc794/1282611901147/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"VMWare Fusion step 6\" width=\"520\" height=\"130\" /><br /><br />Aha. It turns out the the light version only comes with VMWare tools to support the Windows and Mac OS. The full version includes support for a wide variety of operating systems. Why wasn't this important point mentioned in the first place? <br /><br />I don't want to sound like an Apple snob here, but I don't have experiences like this when purchasing third-party software for the Mac. When I buy software, I expect high-quality software. And my expectations extend to the online presence of the developer: I expect the design and messages on the developer's Web site to focus on generating a positive customer experience through the entire process (to include purchasing and upgrading). I don't expect what I <em>used to experience all the time</em> when buying software online in my Windows days: vague descriptions, bundled 'complimentary' subscriptions, shifty designs to encourage click-through on money-making bits, and other clever marketing ploys that emphasize making money over concern for the customer. <br /><br />Message to VMWare: this kind of nonsense does not inspire customer loyalty. I could pack up and move to <a href=\"http://www.parallels.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Parallels</a>. You should really treat me better. <br /><br />Now that I've got that off my chest, I'm happy to report that the new version of VMWare works quite well. I'm happy with it.<br /><br />If you do buy VMWare Fusion 3.0, be sure to download the free <a href=\"http://db.tidbits.com/article/10692\" target=\"_blank\">Take Control of VMWare 3</a> from <a href=\"http://db.tidbits.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TidBits</a>. It's free thanks to sponsorship from VMWare. The Take Control e-books are great, by the way &mdash; I've purchased several and find them to be excellent references. They usually cost between $10 to $12 bucks a pop, so this is an exceptional offer.</p>\n",

These are all sampler compilations, so it&rsquo;s hit and miss&mdash;but there are some good songs to be discovered. I&rsquo;m not too surprised about that&mdash;the point of sampler music is to get you to buy albums from the featured label, so it&rsquo;s in their interest to include a solid cross-sample of their best offerings.</p>\n<p>Back in the day (just a few years ago, really), I frequently picked up low-cost or free sampler albums from labels in music stores. These days, I tend to get my music online from two primary sources: iTunes and <a href=\"http://mp3.mondomix.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mondomix</a> (before Mondomix, I frequented the now-defunct Calabash, which was bought out by Mondomix). I haven&rsquo;t bought much from Amazon.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s my point: iTunes doesn&rsquo;t offer much in terms of free &lsquo;sample&rsquo; music beyond the &lsquo;Free Single of the Week.&rsquo; Calabash used to offer a lot of free singles. Mondomix does not, but they do offer streaming radio mixes and a decent <a href=\"http://mondomix.com/en/podcast_tracks.php?fluxpodcast_id=1\" target=\"_blank\">podcast</a> (it&rsquo;s in French, by the way). There are not many online sources that offer a place to pick up free sample compilations anymore. Amazon, it turns out, has some of the best free offerings I&rsquo;ve come across. Who knew.</p>\n<p>At any rate, here&rsquo;s what I think are some of the best of the lot from Amazon&rsquo;s current free &lsquo;International&rsquo; collection:</p>\n<p>- <strong>Pressure Sounds</strong> sampler: solid reggae and dub tracks.<br /> - <strong>Rotana</strong> sampler: great collection of Middle Eastern sounds from a huge label.<br /> - <strong>Saavn</strong> sampler: Bollywood music&hellip;you can&rsquo;t go wrong with Bollywood tracks.<br /> - <strong>Anana</strong> sampler: interesting collection of music from Israel.<br /> - <strong>Epsa</strong> world music sampler: &lsquo;tango &amp; folklore&rsquo; from Argentina.<br /> - <strong>Putamayo</strong> sampler: decent sampler of music from around the globe.<br /> - <strong>Turkish hits</strong>: nice variety of Turkish artists.</p>\n<p>A few other albums of note that I picked up from other collections:</p>\n<p>- A surprisingly good, wide-ranging compilation of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Eternal-Baroque/dp/B0027Z1IC0/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1256775125&amp;sr=1-7\" target=\"_blank\">Baroque music</a>.<br /> - A great collection of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Very-Best-Naxos-Early-Music/dp/B0018R355Q/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1256775926&amp;sr=1-9\" target=\"_blank\">old music</a> (and I mean old&hellip;Medieval and Renaissance period sounds). If you like this sort of thing, by the way, I highly recommend <a href=\"http://www.anonymous4.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Anonymous 4</a>.<br /> - An <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Vanguard-Visionaries-Series-Sampler/dp/B002RLD10G/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1256776063&amp;sr=1-2\" target=\"_blank\">album</a> with five solid blues-folk tracks from influential American artists on the Vanguard label (e.g. Odetta, Ramblin&rsquo; Jack Elliot).</p>\n<p>Oh, and if you&rsquo;re a Mojo Nixon fan (I&rsquo;m not), head to the free album store now.

The rules are simple: start your oeuvre from scratch, meet the the minimum novel length, and submit your entry at the end of the month. That's about all there is to it.<br /><br />What a great idea. The writing window for the event is ludicrously short by design. Rest assured that your novel will probably suck, and take solace in the fact that most other entries will equally suck. Who cares? And that's the point: it's OK. Just write. A deadline imposed by an outside force may help you to finally start that great work of fiction lurking in the shadows of your mind. Focus on quantity, worry about the quality later. Starting the writing process is often the hardest part, and this yearly event is a clever, fun way to get you started.<br /><br />So, if you're up to the challenge, why not try out a couple of writing-focused Mac tools? Here's a couple of good deals tied to the event: <br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignright\" title=\"Scrivener\" src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc781/1282611865653/#img.jpg.com/scrivener.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Scrivener</strong></a>. Download the <a href=\"http://www.literatureandlatte.com/nanowrimo.html\" target=\"_blank\">trial version</a> of this excellent writing tool for a special extended period that runs through Dec. 7 (longer than the usual 30-day trial period). Use Scrivener to research, organize, and write your breakthrough novel. If you reach your 50,000-word NaNoWriMo goal, you can buy Scrivener for 50 percent off the regular price ($40). If you don't make your goal, but still want to buy Scrivener, take advantage of a 20 percent discount by entering the discount code 'NANOWRIMO' in the coupon text field in their online store. Good deal. I've used Scrivener since July 2007, and I'm quite fond of it. It's a great creative writing tool, and adapts well to a variety of research and writing tasks.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://storyist.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignright\" title=\"Storyist\" src=\"http://vfd.troykitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/img.jpg/index.html\"><strong>Storyist</strong></a>. Here's another novel-focused app that aims to serve your research, word processing, and storyboarding needs. If you want to buy a copy to help you through NaNoWriMo, you can get 25 percent off the purchase price of the boxed ($79) or download ($59) version of the app by entering the coupon code 'NANOWRIMO' in the coupon text field in their online store.  If you want to try out Storyist for the duration of NaNoWriMo before you buy, send Storyist a <a href=\"mailto: info@storyist.com\">message</a> to get a trial copy that'll keep working through the first week in December. If you decide to join the NaNoWriMo challenge <em>and</em> can make it to San Francisco for the kickoff event, you can <a href=\"http://storyist.com/nanowrimo/\" target=\"_blank\">get a free copy</a> of the app. Lastly,  Storyist is giving away two Kindles with $50 gift cards for those who raise the most money for the event &mdash; similar to a walk-a-thon, you can line up sponsors for your NaNoWriMo effort via <a href=\"http://www.gifttool.com/athon/AthonDetails?ID=1891&amp;AID=777\" target=\"_blank\">Giftool.com</a> if you're so inclined. Proceeds go to creative writing programs around the world.</p>\n",

Sometimes it would sync, sometimes it would not. It drove me crazy. Often, it would appear to sync correctly, but selecting a feed would result in a blank screen or (even more annoying) a blank screen with an embedded advertisement.

We usually use my iPhone to dial in a driving route, but on this occasion my wife fired up her Touch.

				"content_html": "<p>We&rsquo;re about to head North to my home state of Maine for a couple of weeks, a place I haven&rsquo;t lived for 20 years. Over the past two decades, I&rsquo;ve moved from Colorado, to Boston, to Guam, to Germany, back to Boston, to Germany again, to Hawaii, and (most recently) to Washington, DC. For work and pleasure, I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of traveling throughout Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and around the Pacific Rim. Yet I still consider myself to be from Maine. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I&rsquo;ve missed most about Maine over the years, aside from family, is the remoteness of the place. At points past Bangor, you can still get properly lost. There&rsquo;s the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, a natural water park over 90 miles long best seen by canoe. There&rsquo;s Baxter State Park, where you can hike to a distant pond, cast your fly rod all day, and not once hear or see another human. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And there&rsquo;s a vast section of unnamed townships between Bangor and Eastport riddled with lakes, covered by trees, and connected by logging roads. It&rsquo;s one of many places in Maine where moose and deer outnumber people. It&rsquo;s here that we&rsquo;ll be staying with my folks at their camp on the edge of a very large lake sparsely populated with a few camps, cabins, and campsites. It&rsquo;s a quiet place. It&rsquo;s far from other people, electricity, running water, or many of the other amenities we&rsquo;re accustomed to in our urban environment. And we can&rsquo;t wait to get there.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When I was a kid, I used to explore the world with the aid of a small shortwave radio and dream about leaving Maine. I would often spend hours at night, alone in my room, slowly churning through the channels. I could usually get Voice of America and the BBC. I would often pick up French language stations from Quebec. I once picked up an English language broadcast from Cuba. And, weather permitting, every so often I would pick up broadcasts in German, Chinese, or Russian. It was exhilarating. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->These days, I experience much of the world through the glare of LCD screens. At work, I spend the bulk of my days in front of dual monitors, shuffling between applications and responding to e-mails. At home, I often find myself sitting in front of another set of dual monitors, shuffling between a similar bunch of applications. And wherever I go, I carry my trusty iPhone. When I&rsquo;m not working on a project, I&rsquo;m likely managing multiple e-mail accounts, or floating between different social media sites, or surfing the Web, or doing something online.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->While I&rsquo;m a big fan of technology and gadgetry, the amazing ease and convenience many of us have grown to expect comes at a cost. Today, I can casually read news, hear radio stations, or watch broadcasts from all over the world. I can chat with friends in Europe as if they were next door. I&rsquo;m never disconnected from the Internet. Yet I rarely feel that sense of mystery and exploration that I experienced surfing for distant voices over the airwaves. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That&rsquo;s why I still like to listen to shortwave from time to time. It takes work. You need to find the right bands, you need to dial slowly, and you need to rely on chance because reception is tied to atmospheric conditions. Sometimes you find interesting broadcasts, sometimes you don&rsquo;t. Sometimes you only pick up the background radiation of the universe. In all cases, you can only listen. I like that.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m looking forward to visiting Maine. It&rsquo;ll be nice to get away from the city and unplug for a while. I&rsquo;ll also be taking a shortwave radio. For an hour or so during the trip, I plan to canoe out into the lake at dark, put on some headphones and see what I can tune in.</p>\n",

There's Baxter State Park, where you can hike to a distant pond, cast your fly rod all day, and not once hear or see another human. <br/><br/>And there's a vast section of unnamed townships between Bangor and Eastport riddled with lakes, covered by trees, and connected by logging roads. It's one of many places in Maine where moose and deer outnumber people. It's here that we'll be staying with my folks at their camp on the edge of a very large lake sparsely populated with a few camps, cabins, and campsites. It's a quiet place. It's far from other people, electricity, running water, or many of the other amenities we're accustomed to in our urban environment. And we can't wait to get there.<br/><br/>When I was a kid, I used to explore the world with the aid of a small shortwave radio and dream about leaving Maine. I would often spend hours at night, alone in my room, slowly churning through the channels. I could usually get Voice of America and the BBC. I would often pick up French language stations from Quebec. I once picked up an English language broadcast from Cuba. And, weather permitting, every so often I would pick up broadcasts in German, Chinese, or Russian. It was exhilarating. <br/><br/>These days, I experience much of the world through the glare of LCD screens. At work, I spend the bulk of my days in front of dual monitors, shuffling between applications and responding to e-mails. At home, I often find myself sitting in front of another set of dual monitors, shuffling between a similar bunch of applications. And wherever I go, I carry my trusty iPhone. When I'm not working on a project, I'm likely managing multiple e-mail accounts, or floating between different social media sites, or surfing the Web, or doing something online.<br/><br/>While I'm a big fan of technology and gadgetry, the amazing ease and convenience many of us have grown to expect comes at a cost. Today, I can casually read news, hear radio stations, or watch broadcasts from all over the world. I can chat with friends in Europe as if they were next door. I'm never disconnected from the Internet. Yet I rarely feel that sense of mystery and exploration that I experienced surfing for distant voices over the airwaves. <br/><br/>That's why I still like to listen to shortwave from time to time. It takes work. You need to find the right bands, you need to dial slowly, and you need to rely on chance because reception is tied to atmospheric conditions. Sometimes you find interesting broadcasts, sometimes you don't. Sometimes you only pick up the background radiation of the universe. In all cases, you can only listen. I like that.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to visiting Maine. It'll be nice to get away from the city and unplug for a while. I'll also be taking a shortwave radio. For an hour or so during the trip, I plan to canoe out into the lake at dark, put on some headphones and see what I can tune in.\n",

Recently, I was asked to put together a presentation about what it takes to produce it. To that end, I made the following video at home on my Mac using a product called <a href=\"http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/overview.htm\" target=\"_blank\">ScreenFlow</a> from Telestream.</p>\n<p>This screencast provides an overview of the workflow involved in the podcast production process, with a few tips specifically relevant to those who work in the Federal government. However, it's aimed at a general audience. If you're interested in making a podcast with interviews, it'll give you a good sense of the time and resources involved.</p>\n<p>It's also a demonstration of ScreenFlow, an outstanding screencasting application. I purchased ScreenFlow a few months ago, and intend to use it for some future projects on this site. It's a bit pricey at $99, but well worth it if you have the need. It's as easy to use as iMovie, and I think the results are stunning. Enjoy.</p>\n",

Soundtrack Pro does podcasting as well, but I&rsquo;ve found that the best way to use it is to export an uncompressed AIF file, and then work with that in GarageBand.

I was intrigued, and E-mailed the developer to ask if a Mac version was on the way. <br /><br />Well, a browser version of SpaceTime3D is now in public Beta. It works on any platform and in any modern browser (with Flash plug-in installed). The browser version of SpaceTime3D is not as feature-rich as the stand-alone Windows desktop application, but it offers the main feature: visual 3D representation of search results. I tested out SpaceTime3D using FireFox 3. <br /><br />My take? It has potential. While it's not going to supplant Google search, I view it as more of a complement to traditional text-based searching. Unlike text-based search results, SpaceTime gives you results and full-page previews at the same time, so you don't have to toggle back and forth between pages and search results. This can be time-saving in some instances. However, it would be nice to be able to toggle back and forth between visual and text views of search results on the fly. I say that because I don't feel like I get the same at-a-glance feedback that I do with a text search page. I don't get a good sense of where I am or how well my search term returned what I was seeking. Perhaps it's just a matter of getting used to a new way of searching. <br /><br />There are some nice touches in the SpaceTime3D Beta. For instance, the search field presents 'autosuggestions' of words or phrases as you type. And you can switch between search engines while retaining your search term so you don't have to type it in again. It also looks great. For a Mac user, the eye candy of the 3D presentation of Web pages will not be too surprising (we're accustomed to reflective-surface eye candy). Windows users may be more impressed. The glaring exception to the nice presentation are the Google Ads, which are distracting and not well integrated. They look like an afterthought. <br /><br />While there are many features that would make SpaceTime3D more useful as a powerful search tool, I'm not going to go into that in any detail. And that's because it's not really a powerful search tool.  If I'm in serious search mode, I'll use Google. But what if I'm in casual-browse mode? I think that's where SpaceTime3D has most to offer, and there's a lot of room within this space. I found that it was quite enjoyable to browse through images with this tool, for instance. And I could imagine it might be a fun way to navigate through social media sites. For example, it would be a nice way to browse through Flickr photos tagged with a given search term. Or to surf random sites within a topic or set of topics via StumbleUpon. It would be interesting to see tighter integration in this realm. The main point here is that I see SpaceTime3D as a tool for discovery, not for focused searching. <br /><br />Here are the main shortcomings. First, it can be pokey. I find that it's fairly responsive on my broadband connection and Intel iMac, but I often have to wait a bit for all the image previews to load. That's not unexpected and it's not meant as a criticism. It's an observation that some people may be disappointed by the speed relative to the nearly-instantaneous search results that we've come to enjoy from Google. Second, the search results you get are screenshots of Web pages, not the pages. This means you can't click on a link on a page in the 3D browsing environment. You can only click on the image of the page, which then opens up that page in a new window. Third, there is no easy way to refine a search without starting all over again. <br /><br />Still, I see SpaceTime3D as an interesting foray into the world of 3D visualization on the desktop and in the browser, something that will likely become commonplace within a few years. I'll be interested to see how the tool develops over time. I've sent in some ideas to the developer about adding more filtering options to refine search results, and I've found them to be very responsive and open to ideas. And, I should add, they have a lot ideas in the queue to make this a better tool. Give it a try and see what you think.</p>\n",

The controversy revolves around what these kind of steeply-discounted bundles portend for third-party Mac developers. Will it ruin their ability to make a decent profit? Will it kill or maim third party development? Well, it's the third year of the MacHeist bundle, and I say the developers know well what they're getting in to. I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.<br /><br />What we, users of Mac apps, need to know is that bundles are great deals, and MacHeist is hard to pass up. This year, I initially thought I'd pass on MacHeist, but I ended up purchasing it...even though I had no interest in many of the apps. Why? Because I could re-gift the ones I didn't want to my friends, and the few I did want justified the relatively small price. The price, by the way, is $39 for over $600 of apps, and if all applications are 'unlocked' (meaning they sell enough bundles) three more apps will be included to raise the total value to $950.  Twenty-five percent of each bundle purchase goes to charity, which is an added incentive and a nice touch.<br /><br />I decided to buy this bundle for <a href=\"http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap/\" target=\"_blank\">Wiretap Studio</a> so I could try this out as a replacement for my much-appreciated, but aging license of <a href=\"http://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/\" target=\"_blank\">Audio Hijack Pro</a>. What appeals to me about Wiretap is a much more simple interface and what looks to be a better (again, simpler) way to hijack audio. I also decided to spring for the bundle to get a <a href=\"http://www.kinemac.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kinemac</a> license. It looks like a promising app to create nice 3D animations, and at a retail price of $300, it's software that I wouldn't otherwise try. <br /><br />Finally, I'm interested in <a href=\"http://macrabbit.com/espresso/\" target=\"_blank\">Espresso</a> 1.0 from MacRabbit, creator of my much-loved <a href=\"http://macrabbit.com/cssedit/\" target=\"_blank\">CSSEdit</a>. I use <a href=\"http://macromates.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TextMate</a>, but I have to say...there haven't been many updates over the past few years. Espresso, on the other hand, seems poised to mature rapidly. Most people say it's a <a href=\"http://www.panic.com/coda/\" target=\"_blank\">Panic Coda</a> competitor, which I don't use. I do, however, use <a href=\"http://www.panic.com/transmit/\" target=\"_blank\">Panic's Transmit</a>. If Espresso competently handles the chores that I rely on with TextMate and Transmit, then I'm all for it. I'm counting on the eventual unlocking of this app, I should add. It's the last app in the bundle, and I'm not clear what it'll take get unlocked. Still, every bundle I've purchased in the past has reached sale levels that permit unlocking of all apps, so I'm somewhat confident MacHeist will reach that goal. If not, I'm still content. It's still a good deal. <br /><br />P.S. After I bought the bundle, I was pleasantly surprised by two apps. I like the included game '<a href=\"http://2dboy.com/games.php\" target=\"_blank\">World of Goo</a>.' It's a lot fun and has great style. And I'm pleased with <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/\" target=\"_blank\">LittleSnapper</a>, a screen capture utility from the makers of <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/\" target=\"_blank\">RapidWeaver</a>, a great web development tool.  As a user of <a href=\"http://www.yellowmug.com/snapndrag/\" target=\"_blank\">SnapNDrag</a> and <a href=\"http://skitch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Skitch</a> for capturing and manipulating screenshots, I thought I wouldn't get much from LittleSnapper. But I like it. I like the library management, the clean and professional look of added text and other accoutrements (including callouts) that I can easily add to screenshots, and the ability to blur parts of my screenshots. It's still early in my testing phase, but this appears to be a promising tool that might just displace SnapNDrag and Skitch.</p>\n",

I'm a huge fan. I purchased OmniWeb long ago to take advantage of this browsers powerful features. It used to cost $15, but now cost nothing as of last Wednesday.<br /><br />There are many features of this browser that make it special.<br /><br />OmniWeb can manually store a set of pages in a 'workspace' so that you can easily recall them later. For instance, I have created a named workspace with five sites I use for work; a named workspace with sites related to house hunting; and named workspaces for two different projects I'm currently researching. Handy.  <br /><br />It also displays thumbnail previews of open pages in a fly-out window, which is a nice way to visually navigate between sites.<br /><br />The best part is that it allows you to save unique settings for individual domains. This is useful for anyone, but particularly useful in terms of accessibility. My father-in-law, for example, has bad eyesight and is not computer saavy. So I set him up with an OmniWeb workspace. All he has to do is click on his workspace, and all his favorite financial sites load. For each site, I used OW's per-domain settings to boost text size to the largest settings possible without breaking each respective site. I also set up each of his favorite sites to open at a particular place on the page so he doesn't have to scroll around to get to the sections he most wants to read. And I set per-site ad blocking: this feature is fine-grained enough to select blocking of known ad sizes, pop-ups, third-party sites, and/or blocked URLs. OmniWeb allows you to optimize an individual domain so you get only what you really want to see. Again, handy.<br /><br />There's a whole lot I like about OmniWeb, so I was glad to read that the browser will continue to be updated by OmniGroup (at least through version 6.0 -- it's now at 5.9). I'd like to see it go open source some day, but that's not going to happen in the short term. By the way, the browser runs on WebKit, the same engine used by Safari.<br /><br />The <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/\">Omni Group</a> also made several other apps free last week, including the screen effects and presentation tool <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnidazzle/\">OmniDazzle</a>, the memory optimization tool <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/developer/omniobjectmeter/\">OmniObjectMeter</a>, and the disk cleanup tool <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnidisksweeper/\">OmniDiskSweeper</a>. <br /></p>\n",

I've read that it's used in all kinds of places: to display Adobe Help files, in Device Central (to preview how applications would look in different mobile devices), in Photoshop, in Bridge, and in Dreamweaver (which has apparently been using Opera since Macromedia days). I'm sure this is only a partial list. <br /><br />With a little digging, I found the hidden Opera installation in the bundled contents of Adobe Bridge (you need to view the application's package contents to peer inside).<br /><br />I discovered Opera was on my system when opening a torrent. Expecting <a href=\"http://www.transmissionbt.com/\">Transmission</a> to open up, I was surprised to see an Opera browser window. This, it turns out, is a common occurrence. If you run in to this, the easy solution is to right click the .torrent file, choose 'Get Info,' and then choose Transmission. Then choose 'Change All' so that all future torrent files will open with Transmission.<br /><br />While I was a bit annoyed to see a browser I never installed on my machine, I'm not going to do anything about it since it's needed by my Adobe apps. But it should stay there, behind the scenes. I think I know how this happened. I recently reinstalled Mac OS X and reinstalled all of my applications. I installed the Adobe Creative Suite, and I later installed Transmission. When I opened a torrent link, the Mac OS had was still associating all .torrent files with Opera, as that was (prior to installing Transmission) the only application on my system that would accept this file type. That explains why I had to re-associate the file type. So the real problem here is that the Mac OS associated a file type with an application that is hidden inside a bundle. That seems like odd behavior to me.<br /><br />And since I'm talking about Adobe applications, I can't pass up the chance to rant about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard\">Dvorak-Qwerty</a>. All Adobe apps that were once Macromedia apps (Dreamweaver, Flash, Fireworks) function as expected with the Dvorak-Qwerty keyboard layout. All other Adobe apps do not support the D-Q layout. <br /><br />This drives me crazy. We're now on the fourth iteration of the Creative Suites, and this inconsistency persists. Guess it's time to send Adobe another message.</p>\n",

It's called Raven, and it joins, well, an aviary of other online applications: Phoenix (image editor), Peacock (dubbed a 'visual laboratory'), Toucan (color manager), and Phoenix (an image editor). <br /><br />These tools are powerful, free to use, and tightly integrated (meaning you can pass your work of art seamlessly back and forth between the different applications). But what really intrigues me about Aviary is where it's heading. <br /><br />In addition to the current flock of Aviary applications, there are many, many more interesting creative <a href=\"http://aviary.com/tools\">applications coming</a>. We're talking everything from an audio editor to a terrain generator to a word processor. And the Aviary team plans to eventually offer offline versions of their tools via Adobe AIR at some point in the future (interesting to note that Adobe already has an online <a href=\"https://www.acrobat.com/\">office suite</a>, and I've read that they plan to bring many of their creative tools to the web, a la <a href=\"https://www.photoshop.com/express/landing.html\">Photoshop Express</a>). <br /><br />The tools at Aviary are free to use, and are well worth your time to check out. No, Phoenix is not as powerful as Photoshop. And no, Raven is not as powerful as Illustrator. But how many users really need that much power? For casual creation, artistic exploration, and simple projects, Aviary is fun and easy to use. I especially like experimenting with Peacock. If the interface seems weird, it's only because we've become so use to Adobe's way of doing things.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://aviary.com/tools\"><img class=\"alignright\" title=\"Aviary, a collection of online design and editing tools\" src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f115be4b0b2818fdcc712/1282611661183/#img.jpg1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Aviary\" width=\"280\" height=\"270\" /></a><br /><br />Basic usage is free. The catch is that Aviary is, at heart, a social site. So free usage means you are prepared to share your work of art with the world. Also, while you own the full rights to all works you create, Aviary retains a license to display any works you make viewable to the public \"within Aviary and in any external publication provided it's in a way that promotes Aviary.\" Also note that your work will be accessible by others, so someone else can mash up your image and repost it. In this case, your name will appear in the attribution in the new derivative work. It's a great model for encouraging social creativity and sharing.<br /><br />If you want more control (and more privacy), a pro-level subscription is $10 a month. If you are interested in using these tools to create artwork for, say, a Web site, you'll want to pay the fee. Not a bad deal when you factor in the considerable capabilities of these applications and compare with the cost of Adobe applications. No, Aviary is not as powerful as an Adobe app, but if you can't afford or don't want to purchase an Adobe app or Suite, Aviary offers some powerful tools to create some great art.<br /><br />I'm an Adobe CS owner and daily user for work and home tasks. I like my Adobe applications. But I hope that services like Aviary thrive. I'd hate to see Adobe completely own the design and editing tool space both on <em>and</em> offline (... and they already own the offline space). <br /><br />Competition is good, and Aviary is one of many alternatives out there offering innovation and quality service.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I spent the past month on a ship out in the Gulf of Mexico serving as a data manager for a research expedition. I won&rsquo;t bore you with details about what I was doing, but I want to share some observations about my computing experience. I brought aboard a new 15&quot; Macbook Pro running Leopard with a virtual install (using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VMWare Fusion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) of Windows 7 Beta. Windows was essential, as the database in which I did my day-to-day work was not Mac compatible. Here are some highlights:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Data sharing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: While many of the people on the trip used Macs, several people used PCs. Among us, we probably had about 30 Terabytes or so of external disk storage. Problems arose when we needed to share data. The PC people&rsquo;s drives were generally formatted in NTFS. The Mac people typically used HFS+. The NTFS-formatted drives would mount on a Mac, but were read-only. The HFS+ drives would not mount on Windows PCs. No one used the FAT32 format, which is the only format that I&rsquo;m aware of that is read/write on both platforms. We ended up formatting a few drives in the FAT32 format so these drives could be moved around and shared. Since my disk was one of the external drives that had to be shared around more than others, my solution was to set it up with multiple partitions: an HFS+ partition to use for my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SuperDuper<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Clone backup, and a FAT32 partition for shared data. One interesting note: I formatted a 1TB drive with multiple partitions on a Mac in a matter of minutes. In comparison, it took about eight hours to format a 1TB drive with one FAT partition on a very robust and powerful PC laptop. Egads.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Data backup<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I was surprised that many people did not have a backup solution on the cruise. If their laptop tanked, they would not only potentially lose data, they would be out of commission for the duration of the expedition. I choose a cloned backup over Time Machine for this trip. The reason is simple: if something went terribly wrong with my laptop&rsquo;s OS, I could at least boot from the cloned external drive and keep working until a point in time when I could take a time out to restore from the clone back. With Time Machine, I would have had to stop working until I solved the problem or restored the backup to the laptop (which can be very time consuming).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Force-eject a CD<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: It&rsquo;s good to know how to do <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. At one point during my trip, I placed a corrupted DVD in my SuperDrive and couldn&rsquo;t get it to eject. Usually, I can get a stuck disc to pop out by evoking terminal and typing the command &lsquo;drutil tray eject.&rsquo; That didn&rsquo;t work. I tried disk utility. That didn&rsquo;t work.  The solution: I had to disconnect the drive from Windows, as it was in use by Windows via VMWare Fusion.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TextExpander<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: Data entry often entails typing the same thing over and over again. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TextExpander<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is unbelievably useful for these sorts of repetitive tasks. In my case, I needed to paste the same blocks of text into my Windows database. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if TextExpander would work from Mac to PC, but it did. It wasn&rsquo;t as easy as it is on the Mac (i.e., I couldn&rsquo;t use TextExpander abbreviations in Windows), but it did the job. Once I had TextExpander populated with a slew of repetitive text snippets, all I had to do was select a snippet from the Mac drop-down menu, then click on it to paste it to the clipboard, then paste into the relevant field in my Windows database. It was a bit cumbersome, but much easier than typing the same thing over and over again.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Screenshots<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I was planning to use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Little Snapper<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to capture screen shots, but found this application to be too cumbersome and bloated for my tastes. I like the idea behind Little Snapper. It looks great. But it just didn&rsquo;t fit into my workflow. I found myself turning to Yellow Mug&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SnapnDrag<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s tiny, unobtrusive, and does the job well. It stays out of the way.

				"content_text": "I spent the past month on a ship out in the Gulf of Mexico serving as a data manager for a research expedition. I won't bore you with details about what I was doing, but I want to share some observations about my computing experience. I brought aboard a new 15\" Macbook Pro running Leopard with a virtual install (using <a href=\"http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/\" target=\"_blank\">VMWare Fusion</a>) of Windows 7 Beta. Windows was essential, as the database in which I did my day-to-day work was not Mac compatible. Here are some highlights:<br/><br/>- <strong>Data sharing</strong>: While many of the people on the trip used Macs, several people used PCs. Among us, we probably had about 30 Terabytes or so of external disk storage. Problems arose when we needed to share data. The PC people's drives were generally formatted in NTFS. The Mac people typically used HFS+. The NTFS-formatted drives would mount on a Mac, but were read-only. The HFS+ drives would not mount on Windows PCs. No one used the FAT32 format, which is the only format that I'm aware of that is read/write on both platforms. We ended up formatting a few drives in the FAT32 format so these drives could be moved around and shared. Since my disk was one of the external drives that had to be shared around more than others, my solution was to set it up with multiple partitions: an HFS+ partition to use for my <a href=\"http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html\" target=\"_blank\">SuperDuper</a> Clone backup, and a FAT32 partition for shared data. One interesting note: I formatted a 1TB drive with multiple partitions on a Mac in a matter of minutes. In comparison, it took about eight hours to format a 1TB drive with one FAT partition on a very robust and powerful PC laptop. Egads.<br/><br/>- <strong>Data backup</strong>: I was surprised that many people did not have a backup solution on the cruise. If their laptop tanked, they would not only potentially lose data, they would be out of commission for the duration of the expedition. I choose a cloned backup over Time Machine for this trip. The reason is simple: if something went terribly wrong with my laptop's OS, I could at least boot from the cloned external drive and keep working until a point in time when I could take a time out to restore from the clone back. With Time Machine, I would have had to stop working until I solved the problem or restored the backup to the laptop (which can be very time consuming).<br/><br/>- <strong>Force-eject a CD</strong>: It's good to know how to do <a href=\"http://guides.macrumors.com/Force_Eject_a_Stuck_CD_or_DVD\" target=\"_blank\">this</a>. At one point during my trip, I placed a corrupted DVD in my SuperDrive and couldn't get it to eject. Usually, I can get a stuck disc to pop out by evoking terminal and typing the command 'drutil tray eject.' That didn't work. I tried disk utility. That didn't work.  The solution: I had to disconnect the drive from Windows, as it was in use by Windows via VMWare Fusion.<br/><br/>- <strong>TextExpander</strong>: Data entry often entails typing the same thing over and over again. <a href=\"http://www.smileonmymac.com/TextExpander/\" target=\"_blank\">TextExpander</a> is unbelievably useful for these sorts of repetitive tasks. In my case, I needed to paste the same blocks of text into my Windows database. I wasn't sure if TextExpander would work from Mac to PC, but it did. It wasn't as easy as it is on the Mac (i.e., I couldn't use TextExpander abbreviations in Windows), but it did the job. Once I had TextExpander populated with a slew of repetitive text snippets, all I had to do was select a snippet from the Mac drop-down menu, then click on it to paste it to the clipboard, then paste into the relevant field in my Windows database. It was a bit cumbersome, but much easier than typing the same thing over and over again.<br/><br/>- <strong>Screenshots</strong>: I was planning to use <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/\" target=\"_blank\">Little Snapper</a> to capture screen shots, but found this application to be too cumbersome and bloated for my tastes. I like the idea behind Little Snapper. It looks great. But it just didn't fit into my workflow. I found myself turning to Yellow Mug's <a href=\"http://www.yellowmug.com/snapndrag/\" target=\"_blank\">SnapnDrag</a>. It's tiny, unobtrusive, and does the job well. It stays out of the way. I've tried so many different screen shots apps, and I keep coming back to SnapnDrag. <br/><br/>- <strong>iPhone</strong>: The only entertainment I brought on my trip was my iPhone. I brought music, books-on-tape, games, and some books to read via the <em>Kindle</em> and <em>Stanza</em> book reading apps. Overall, the iPhone did the job. I was duly entertained. The one exception is this: the tiny screen didn't cut it for reading a book. It's a nice idea. It's not bad for quick reads like poetry or short stories. But it's just not a comfortable or enjoyable experience when it comes to reading an entire book in my opinion. Next time I'll bring a real book.

				"content_text": "<p>Now for something completely different.<br /><br />Let's talk about entrainment, the process by which wave frequencies in two or more interacting systems with different periods eventually lock into phase. You see it nature, for example, when fireflies start blinking together in unison. You hear it in music when different instruments in a jam session start to vibrate together in harmony. It even happens in our bodies. When you slow your breath, it leads to a slowing of heartbeat and brainwaves.<br /><br />Now let's talk about binaural beats. Binaural beats are perceived sounds which naturally arise in the brain when two slightly different frequencies are played separately into each ear. It's best explained with an example: if you listen to a 405 Hz frequency (sine wave) in one ear and a 398 Hz wave in the other ear, your brainwaves will start to oscillate towards a frequency of 7 Hz, or the difference between the two sounds. This process happens through entrainment. <br /><br />Here's the interesting part: while human hearing is limited to an approximate range of frequencies between 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, brainwave frequencies associated with relaxation, REM sleep, meditation, and deep sleep fall below the 20 Hz threshold.</p>\n<h3>Huh?</h3>\n<p>What this means is that binaural beats can, in theory, be used to entrain your brain to frequencies that fall below perceived human hearing. If you search for brain entrainment on the Web, you'll find a slew of articles, thing for sale, and wild claims. And I know of at least one institute that will gladly take lots of your money to provide you with a life-changing (patented) brain entrainment experience at their facility.<br /><br />My interest is more casual. I first came across the idea of binaural beats and brain entrainment back in the early 1990s while researching a paper in college. I found the idea intriguing. I played around with an oscilloscope to observe two waves suddenly lock together after growing closer and closer together. I found the idea of it fascinating. <br /><br />Then, at some point (the timeline is a bit fuzzy), I came across a sound editor called <em>Syntrillium Cool Edit Pro</em>. This was a classy PC audio editor that once, to my surprise, included a somewhat-obscure menu for creating sound files for brain entrainment using binaural beats and pink noise. I tried it. I liked it. While I didn't have any crazy experiences, I did find that some of the files I created were effective for relaxation, meditation, and focus. <br /><br />As I recall, the brain entrainment submenu disappeared at the next<em> Cool Edit Pro</em> software update after I started using it. I don't know why. Then, years later, Cool Edit Pro was bought out by Adobe. It is now called Adobe Audition. <br /><br />Fast forward to 2009. While the auditory intrigue of brain entrainment (or, more accurately, the effects of this technique) remains in the speculative and hypothetical range, there are now several choices for the PC and the iPhone/Touch to try this out for yourself. The desktop programs are nice, but these are audio-centric apps that require headphones. It should come as no surprise, then, that the iPhone/Touch apps really shine.</p>\n<h3>Here's what you can get for your Mac, Windows, or Linux box</h3>\n<p>&lt;1. <a href=\"http://uazu.net/sbagen/\" target=\"_blank\">SBaGen.</a> (Mac, Linux, Windows) This is a good, free choice if you like to roll your own, are comfortable with the Terminal, and don't mind getting your hands a bit dirty. There are sample sounds for backgrounds you can download at the site. If you want to have some fun, and are the type of person who likes the DIY ethic, try it out.<br /><br />2. <a href=\"http://www.bwgen.com/download.htm\" target=\"_blank\">BrainWave Generator.</a> (Windows only) This isn't a Mac app, but I used it in my PC days. It hasn't really changed at all since those days, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's like SBaGen, but it has a Windows user interface and is much easier to use. It offers a lot of user control to fine tune frequency settings. It's shareware. It now costs $40 to buy a private license, which is steep for an app that hasn't been updated since 2005. <br /><br />2. <a href=\"http://pzizz.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pzizz.</a> (Mac, Windows) I tried the trial when it first came out a while back. It uses binaural beats, but also mixes in sound effects, people talking, and music in some sort of fancy algorithm. Many people like it. I didn't care for it. Why? I can only say it's a matter of personal preference. I preferred the free SBaGen. I preferred it, that is, until I found the iPhone apps.</p>\n<h3>But this was made for the iPhone/Touch</h3>\n<p>1.<a href=\"http://www.rockifone.com/uncategorized/binaural-beats/\" target=\"_blank\"> Binaural Beats.</a> Free. Offers presets with nice background music. You can also try <em>Easy Relax Ultimate</em> from the same company for $2.99. I found the free <em>Binaural Beat</em>s app worked for me as a relaxation and sleep aid.<br /><br />2. <a href=\"http://www.teslasoftware.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AmbiScience.</a> Try the full app for $.99 or the Lite free version. For the price, the $.99 app is nice application that does the job well. It includes entrainment for relaxing, meditating, focusing, or sleeping. The interface is pleasant. I bought it. I use it.<br /><br />3. <a href=\"http://www.mediahead.com/mindwave/\" target=\"_blank\">mind Wave.</a> The cost is $1.99. Haven't tried this one. It includes some interesting choices such as headache treatment, weight loss, and creativity boost. I'm a bit skeptical, but it's not very expensive. You can also opt for \"mind Freek,\" a separate app from the same developer that also costs $1.99, and offers more esoteric settings such as astral projections, out of body experience, etc. Sounds wacky, and results may vary...but it's cheap and may be fun to try. I think I'll probably pass.<br /><br />There you have it. Does this work, or is it pseudoscience? The truth is likely somewhere in between. I will vouch for it as a tool for sleeping, meditation, relaxation, and focus. What is certain is it costs next to nothing to try aural brain entrainment. So why not?</p>\n",

Web development is a primary reason: it's often useful to see how a page renders in different browsers. Beyond that, here are few other reasons I like to choose different browsers on different occasions:<br/><br/><strong><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox</a> plugins</strong>. Sometimes I receive a link in an email and I want to save it in <a href=\"http://delicious.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Delicious</a>. I want to send that link to Firefox in order to take advantage of my Firefox <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615\" target=\"_blank\">Delicious plugin</a>. At other times, I choose FireFox to take advantage of plugins geared towards web development, such as <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60\" target=\"_blank\">web developer</a>.<br/><br/><strong><a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/\" target=\"_blank\">OmniWeb</a> power</strong>. I often like to use OmniWeb to take advantage of some of this browsers powerful features. For example, this browser allows me to set per-page site preferences, save multiple pages into groups for easy retrieval later on, and set up search shortcuts so I can quickly search a particular website right from the search bar. I also prefer the tabbed thumbnail views of all my open pages.<br/><br/><strong><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/safari/\" target=\"_blank\">Safari</a> speed</strong>. Sometimes I choose Safari when I'm casually browsing because it's quite fast.<br/><br/><strong><a href=\"http://fluidapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fluid</a></strong>. When I'm using Fluid (which I use for my work web-based email so it appears as a stand-alone browser application), I usually prefer to open up links received in my inbox with other browsers instead of in another Fluid window. <br/><br/><h3>A few other apps</h3><br/>Here are a few other (semi) related apps worth a look: <br/><br/><strong>- <a href=\"http://www.everydaysoftware.net/bookit/\" target=\"_blank\">Bookit</a></strong>. This is a handy advanced bookmarking application that allows you to keep all your bookmarks synchronized across all of your browsers (and across multiple computers using .Mac). It costs $12. <br/><br/><strong>- <a href=\"http://flip.macrobyte.net/software/ic-switch_en\" target=\"_blank\">IC-switch</a></strong>. This free application sits in your menu bar and allows you to change your default browser, emailer, FTP client, and RSS reader on the fly in one location.<br/><br/><strong>- <a href=\"http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/\" target=\"_blank\">RCDefaultApp</a></strong>. This is a free preference pane that allows you to set the default applications that open for URLs, file types and extensions, and a whole lot more. It's a must-have little management app.\n",

Once you download this app, you can create a fully-legal bootable disc. I own one copy of DiskWarrior. Looking forward to compare and contrast these two tools.<br /> <br />* <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/\" target=\"_blank\">RapidWeaver</a>: Already own two copies of this excellent web creation tool. Hoping to gift this license. RW now costs $80, so this is a good deal.<br /><br />* <a href=\"http://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/\" target=\"_blank\">Default Folder X</a>: A superior open/save tool for the Mac with seamless integration. I've wanted this for quite a long time.<br /><br />* <a href=\"http://www.intego.com/virusbarrier/\" target=\"_blank\">VirusBarrier X5</a>: My wife is going to use this on her laptop. You get a year of virus updates with it. I use the free ClamX AV, occasionally. <br /><br />*<a href=\"http://www.marinersoftware.com/sitepage.php?page=130\" target=\"_blank\"> MacGourmet Deluxe</a>: This one is going to my spouse. There are many positive reviews for this app. Not sure why it's called 'Deluxe,' since there are no other MacGourmet offerings (i.e. non-Deluxe).<br /><br />* <a href=\"http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html\">Little Snitch</a>: Great tool to manage/monitor outgoing network activity. I own a multi-user license of this for all my Macs. Hoping I can gift this or give it away on this site.<br /><br />* <a href=\"http://www.mani.de/ivolume/\">iVolume</a>: Never heard of it, but I've found that I generally like German-made Mac software. Might be useful. This tool corrects the volume levels for your iTunes songs so that all play at the same level. Suprisingly, this feature is not built into iTunes.<br /><br />* <a href=\"http://www.ergonis.com/products/keycue/\" target=\"_blank\">KeyCue</a>: A tool to help you find, learn, and remember menu shortcuts in all of your apps. Excellent aid for those who rely on keyboard shortcuts. Yes, I want this. <br /><br />* <a href=\"http://www.koingosw.com/products/macpilot.php\" target=\"_blank\">MacPilot</a>: Easy access to tons of terminal tweaks and optimizations for your Mac. Looking forward to trying this out. For those who buy the bundle, Koingo Software (developer of MacPilot and other apps) is offering a steeply discounted upgrade ($30) to their $100 'Utility Package,' which includes free lifetime upgrades, and licenses to every application currently on their website. Not a bad deal. <br /><br />* <a href=\"http://www.id-design.com/software/whatsize/\" target=\"_blank\">WhatSize</a>: Allows you to see what files are eating up all of your disk space. Not sure if this will be any better than the free (donationware) tool I currently use (<a href=\"http://www.derlien.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Disk Inventory X</a>). <br /><br />* <a href=\"http://www.aquafadas.com/en/idive-digital-video/\">iDive</a> : This is an app from Aquafadas, a French company. Apparently it's a video organizer. I'll be curious to try it out. I love <a>PulpMotion</a> by these developers (a very unique app picked up in a previous bundle!). This one only goes to the first 10,000 bundle consumers (was originally the first 5,000, but was increased apparently).<br /><br />The offer ends on Dec. 19. You can also choose to gift a bundle to someone else. You might have trouble accessing the site. It's getting slammed with traffic right now. <br /><br />The main question everyone is asking on the forums is about giving away licenses for the apps they already own or don't want. The short answer is that you must either buy the whole bundle, or gift the whole bundle to one person. If you buy the bundle, you get licenses tied to your name. There would be nothing stopping you from giving away that license, I suppose. For the apps I'd like to give to others, I'm going to write to the developers to see if the registered name could be changed. I recall doing this with Parallels when it was offered in a previous bundle, and it worked. <br /><br />Stay tuned for other apps over the holiday season. <a href=\"http://www.macsantadeals.com/\">MacSanta</a> may be coming soon. We may also soon see a new <a href=\"http://www.macheist.com/\">Macheist</a> and another '<a href=\"http://www.givegoodfood2yourmac.com/lapromoestfinie.html\">Give good food 2 your Mac</a>' bundle from Europe.</p>\n",

				"title": "A telework tale",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>So, I now have the opportunity to telework once per week. I must say that I like it. Imagine that. But what makes it so great is not so much working in very casual clothing (that's a nice way of saying 'pajamas'), but that I can work on my Mac using tools that I know and rely on. <br /><br />The thing is, I spend much of my workday at home or the office using the same basic tools: DreamWeaver, PhotoShop, and a text editor. So if I use the same basic software in both environments, why am I so much more efficient at home? Here are some of the reasons I came up with:</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/beta.html\">1. Launchbar</a></h3>\n<p>Launchbar is an application launcher, calculator, easy file opener, etc. It does many, many things. I'm still learning hidden tricks and tips to get more out of this excellent, lightweight application. I expect it to be on any machine I use. When it's not, I get cranky.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.smileonmymac.com/TextExpander/\">2. TextExpander</a></h3>\n<p>If you type the same thing over and over again, TextExpander is a godsend. Use it to assign shortcuts to any text you want. I use it for everything from inserting a redirect link to adding a signature block to inserting an image. You wouldn't believe how much time this tool saves.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://cocoatech.com/\">3. PathFinder</a></h3>\n<p>Finder is anemic. Windows Explorer makes me want to cry. PathFinder rules. One feature I particularly like is the ability to save tab sets. I have about five tabs that I like to have open when working on this site. I have three folders I like to have open when working on office projects. I can save each workflow in distinct tab sets, open each up with a click, and I'm ready to go. Having just upgraded to the new PathFinder 5, I'm also digging the split-pane view. At any rate, the main thing I appreciate about PathFinder is how utterly, completely customizable it is. I have honed it over time. It's uniquely adapted to me. It's a weapon. I love that.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spaces.html\">4. Spaces</a></h3>\n<p>I'm a recent Apple Spaces convert. I didn't think much of it for the longest time, but I'm glad I gave it another look. There are two camps when it comes to using Spaces. Some like dividing up apps into different spaces and some like dividing up tasks within different spaces. It's a subtle difference that you won't really get until you try out both ways. Some may wish to stop reading this paragraph now to prevent a headache. If you want to learn more about the options in Spaces, read on.</p>\n<p>To be fair, even if I was using a Mac at the office, I probably wouldn't be able to install many (or any) of the third-party applications listed here due to IT policies. Still, it's worth pointing out how much utility and efficiency result from third party apps. And to be fair regarding my PC use, there are a couple of tiny free PC apps that I use in the office which do contribute quite a lot to my productivity. One is called <a href=\"http://www.editpadpro.com/editpadlite.html\">EditPad</a>. It's a lightweight text editor that sits in the system tray. It offers tabbed pages and does a nice job of stripping out formating on text so I can pop it into a web page. The other is called <a href=\"http://www.skynergy.com/hotkeyz.html\">HotKeyz</a>. This lets me remap my keyboard (I use the Dvorak layout, and this lets me reassign keys so I can still use Qwerty key combos). Unlike the Mac, Windows does not have a built-in Dvorak-Qwerty alternate keyboard layout. What a shame.</p>\n<p>So, the difference in how Spaces works is defined by checking or un-checking a preference labeled '<em>When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application</em>.' If checked, you will automatically be transported to a space with existing open window for the given app when you select that app (with command-tab). Unchecked, you are not transported to another space when tabbing to an app. Instead, the app is simply selected within that space. You then have the option to open a new window of that app within your space. Alternatively, you can click on the dock icon of that app to cycle through the open windows of that app within different spaces. Note that if you've set up some of your apps to appear only in certain spaces, this won't work as expected. In this instance, selecting an app will not change spaces; but creating a new instance (or page) of that app will transport you back to the space you defined for that app. The solution, then, is to not pre-define your apps to only work within a particular app. Confusing, yes.</p>\n<p>I've settled on the later workflow, opting to make each space task-specific, instead of app-specific. I don't have any apps assigned to particular spaces. That way I can have, say, two different TextMate windows open in two different spaces, which is nice when multi-tasking.</p>\n<p>Either way (app- or task-based Spaces) works, though. Try both out.  What I would really like is to have control on a per-app basis so I could assign a few apps to work only in one space, and other apps to work on a task-management basis within any space.</p>\n<p>At any rate, I've finally got Spaces set up in a useful way. I think it can get better, but it's a lot better than what I have on my Office PC...which is basic tabbing through apps. It annoys me to no end that I can only cycle forward through apps on Windows using command-tab. Stupid.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.unmarked.com/textsoap/\">5. TextSoap</a></h3>\n<p>I'm also fairly new to TextSoap, but it's growing more useful by the day as I learn how to harness its power. If you deal with a lot of text coming at you from various sources and in various forms (and you need to reformat it for the web or to meet some other style guideline), then TextSoap might be a tool for you. You can use it for simple tasks like cleaning those annoying &gt; marks in emails, or you can learn some regex and really work magic on your text. Warning: not for faint of heart. I'm at the stage where I can't do much (ok, anything) with regex, but I'm giving it a go. TextSoap is still very powerful, though, when you use the more than 100 text cleaners pre-loaded on the app.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php\">6. Hazel</a></h3>\n<p>I like Hazel more and more. It's a nice way to automate filing of documents, music files, app downloads, etc. Whenever I download anything to the desktop (or drop a file to the desktop), Hazel takes care of filing it away in the right place for me (it automates color labeling of folders, too). It also has a feature to remove the plist files and other miscellaneous crap associated with a file when you move it to the trash (meaning you no longer need an additional tool like AppZapper). It also takes care of emptying my trash at predefined intervals. Like TextSoap, it's one of those apps that takes a some commitment to learn and set up to your individual preferences, but it pays big dividends.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/pro/tips/colorlabel.html\">7. Color-Labeled folders</a></h3>\n<p>Such a simple thing. How I wish I could colorize some of my Windows folders. When you are looking at a list of dozens upon dozens of folders, it sure is nice to have a few of your favorites color-coded. I know there's that 'favorites' thing in Explorer, but I hate it. Can't say why. Just hate it.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/\">8. OmniWeb</a></h3>\n<p>OmniWeb is not a free browser, which might turn some people off. It shouldn't. It's an amazing browser. Worth every penny. And it's only $15. I bought it a couple of years ago, and haven't had to pay an upgrade fee yet. I most rely on OmniWeb's ability to save groups of pages for easy retrieval in what OmniWeb calls a 'Workspace.' For example, I have four sites that I generally need to have open when working from home. All I need on OmniWeb is open up the 'work' workspace, and all my chosen pages open up. I have about a dozen such saved workspaces for different workflows. I can also take snapshots of pages at particular places. This is handy when I want a site to open and display at a point other than the top of the page. The ad-blocking is also top-notch. As are the per-page setting definitions ... for instance, I set up my father-in-law with the top five financial sites he likes on OmniWeb. Since his eyesight is poor, I adjusted the text size for each site so it was as big as possible without breaking the site. Every one of his favorite sites could handle more or less text size increases. With OmniWeb, I set the optimal large text size so the page still looked good, and it remembers each setting. Brilliant. OmniWeb also has a shared bookmark folder to access bookmarks easily across user accounts. There's much more. It's an incredible browser. It's fast, too.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/quicklook.html\">9. QuickLook</a></h3>\n<p>I expect QuickLook to be on all the machines I use. When it's not, I find myself hitting the space bar repeatedly in frustration.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.culturedcode.com/things/\">10. Things</a></h3>\n<p>I rely on Things to manage my to do list. Everything I enter in Things is automatically synced to my iPhone Things app. And all my 'next up' to do items automatically sync with iCal and Apple Mail. This app is great, and I look forward to purchasing it when 1.0 is released at Mac World next month.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/Yojimbo/\">11. Yojimbo</a></h3>\n<p>I haven't seen a good note/snippet manager for Windows. I'm sure there is one, but I haven't seen it. There are tons of choices for the Mac. Yojimbo is my current favorite app to collect little items that don't fit elsewhere. I wish they'd update this app, though. It's been a long time ... also wish they'd come out with the ability to sync and store notes 'in the cloud' for remote access, and offer an iPhone version. It's not perfect, but it blows away what I have on my PC. Which is a vanilla linear text editor.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/\">12. VooDooPad</a></h3>\n<p>Like Yojimbo, it's a place to dump notes, but it's a different paradigm. It's an elegant little personal wiki. I use it daily. Check out the free Lite version.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.bean-osx.com/Bean.html\">13. Bean</a></h3>\n<p>I probably have ten or so text editors of various shapes and sizes. After paying more money than I care to admit (I'm a bit of a text editor junkie) I find myself using the free Bean more often than not. It just works well, and it's blazing fast.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I finally got around to setting up a few services on my Mac related to dynamic DNS hosting. Having done so, I'm asking myself why I didn't do this long ago. <br /><br />So, what is dynamic DNS? Here's a brief and imperfect overview. Let's start with DNS, or Domain Naming System. This, broadly speaking, is a service that translates hostnames into numbers that a computer can understand, and vice-versa. It's DNS that allows you to type 'www.viewfromthedock.com' instead of a hard-to-remember number like 69.89.31.161 (an IP address). Your computer has an IP address. All the sites you visit have an IP address. Everything that accesses the internet has an IP address.<br /><br />The thing about IP addresses is that, for a variety of reasons, there are only a finite number of them to go around. <br /><br />This affects you directly. Because of this scarcity, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) only has a finite number of addresses to pass out to all the computers using that ISP that wish to access the internet. <br /><br />The result of this shuffling act means that the address of your computer is changing all the time. That makes it hard to get back to your computer if you are remote and need to connect to, say, grab some important documents. Enter the dynamic DNS hosting service. <br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.dyndns.com/\"><img src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f120ce4b0b2818fdccabd/1282610916078/#img.png.com/\"><img src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f120de4b0b2818fdccabe/1282610916071/#img.png1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"OpenDNS\" width=\"106\" height=\"38\" /></a><br />The folks at OpenDNS took a look at dynamic DNS hosting and asked '<em>What else could we do with this</em>?' The result is a service that does a number of interesting things. OpenDNS does not provide you with an unchanging, easy-to-remember hostname (actually, it does track your ever-changing IP address, but only for its own purposes). What it does do is serve as your primary DNS server (instead of the DNS server used by your ISP). You don't need to install any software. You simply need to point your computer (or router) to the OpenDNS DNS servers. Read on if you're not sure why you should care.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.dnsomatic.com/\"><img src=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f120ee4b0b2818fdccabf/1282610916803/#img.png1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DNS-O-Matic\" width=\"106\" height=\"38\" /></a><br />This is a service owned by OpenDNS which basically does one thing: it transmits your current IP address to whatever services you are using. In my case, it ensures that both DynDNS and OpenDNS get my latest IP address from my ISP.</p>\n<h3>So what do I get out of this?</h3>\n<p><br />- With <strong>DynDNS</strong>, I can now use my user-created hostname to help me remotely access files on my Mac using SSH (Secure Shell). If I didn't have DynDNS, I would not know my current ISP-assigned IP address. With it, I always do.<br /><br />- With <strong>OpenDNS</strong>, I get a big boost in speed and reliability when surfing the web. In my case (using Comcast), I would often type in a site address and it would take a bit of time for the page to load. Sometimes, nothing seemed to be happening at all. With OpenDNS, I've experienced a noticeable difference in speed, and I've experienced no delays in page look-ups. <br /><br />- <strong>OpenDNS</strong> also offers several other added features that make it very worthwhile. Essentially, they've taken a basic service (dynamic DNS) and built in a bunch of extra useful stuff built around it. With this service, I can block access to certain types of sites. I get an added layer of built-in phishing protection. I also get sophisticated error-checking (for those times when I type in 'cmo' instead of 'com,' for instance). For those times that OpenDNS can't quite figure out what I'm looking for, the service offers helpful suggestions. I can also create shortcuts (e.g., I created one for this site that enables me to enter 'vfd' in the browser instead of the full web address). Finally, I can view stats related to all of the visited domains and IP addresses accessed through my router.<br /><br />- <strong>DNS-O-Matic</strong>, finally, is a simple service that ensures that DynDNS and OpenDNS always have my latest IP address. If you don't use these services, you may choose to sync your IP address with a whole slew of other similar applications as well. I opted to use this service in lieu of installing the DynDNS client software on my Mac. <br /><br />All three of these services are currently free. It takes a little effort to set it all up, but it's worth it. If you have no need for a consistent hostname for remotely accessing your Mac, then you may not need a service like DynDNS. However, OpenDNS is worth the effort for the speed and reliability boost alone. <br /><br />One final note: OpenDNS collects information about your surfing habits, so be sure to check out their <a href=\"http://www.opendns.com/privacy/\">privacy policy</a>.</p>\n",

				"title": "On Dvorak and the future of the keyboard",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<h3>1. Dvorak-Qwerty redux</h3>\n<p>I decided to test out <a title=\"Tweetdeck\" href=\"http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/\" target=\"_blank\">Tweetdeck</a>, a new Twitter application in Beta developed on the Adobe Air platform. I like it. But when I attempted to hide the app with the shortcut ?-H ... it didn't work. Then it hit me. It's an Adobe app. Of course it doesn't work. That's because I type using a keyboard layout called Dvorak.<br /><br />It's a common enough layout that it's included as an international keyboard option for both the Mac and PC. The Mac also has a unique keyboard layout called 'Dvorak-Qwerty,' which I use. This allows one to type using the Dvorak layout, but use Qwerty key combos. It's a thoughtful tip of the hat to Dvorak users who know and rely on standard Qwerty keyboard shortcuts.<br /><br />Most of the applications on my Mac respect this convention and work very well with the D-Q layout. The glaring exceptions are Microsoft Office and Adobe products. I've given up on Microsoft ever fixing this problem, seeing as the OS still doesn't include a D-Q option (and likely never will). But Adobe? Come on. I can't imagine that fixing this little glitch would take much time. Correct me if I'm wrong, Adobe.<br /><br />I've written about this on Adobe forums, I've sent in suggestions, I've posted on this topic here and on other blogs. Nothing has changed. While I'm sure that there are not <em>many</em> Dvorak typists using Adobe creative suites who rely on Qwerty key combos, I'm surely not the only one! And, hey, we're paying customers. And those suites are expensive.<br /><br />Someday, I hope that Adobe will fix this relatively simple thing. Adobe: take heed that <a title=\"Smile on my Mac\" href=\"http://www.smileonmymac.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Smile on my Mac</a> fixed this same problem with <a title=\"TextExpander\" href=\"http://www.smileonmymac.com/TextExpander/\" target=\"_blank\">TextExpander</a> with one simple update. I wrote to them about the problem. And it was fixed with their next update a few weeks later. Now that's service.</p>\n<h3>2. This Dvorak post rocks</h3>\n<p>So, I got an email a while back from Francis Siefken from the Netherlands, a fellow Dvorak user. He put forward a convincing case that switching the U and the I on the Dvorak keyboard would lead to even greater efficiencies. I love this kind of analysis.<br /><br />Check out his <a title=\"Anamnesis\" href=\"http://anamnesis.nl.eu.org/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> even if you don't use Dvorak, if only to appreciate the time and thought he clearly put into this. It seems that his blog may have went into hiatus after this one post (something that I can certainly appreciate!), but it's worth the read nonetheless. As is how he named his son, which also appears on this page. I hope we'll see more posts on his blog someday soon.<br /><br />My view: why <em>not</em> switch the U and I keys? The point is that the keyboard&mdash;our primary interface to the digital realm&mdash;must continue to evolve. Dvorak, while imperfect, is arguably an evolutionary leap forward from Qwerty. But why stop there? I say let's continue to perfect the layout of keys to meet our needs.<br /><br />Note that Siefken emphasizes that the primary benefit of Dvorak isn't necessarily speed. It's comfort. If you're someone who types a lot (as in all day, every day) it may be worth your time to learn Dvorak if you're not already heavily invested in Qwerty. Let the keyboard evolve, and let repetitive stress be damned!<br /><br />The careful reader might now ask why I don't use Dvorak keyboard shortcuts, preferring instead to keep using Qwerty shortcuts. The answer? The most-used shortcut keys are largely grouped down by the ? key, so it's easier and faster. D-Q is a great combo.</p>\n<h3>3. On the evolution of the keyboard</h3>\n<p>And speaking of the evolution of keyboards, check out the <a title=\"Optimus Maximus\" href=\"http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/\" target=\"_blank\">Optimus Maximus</a>. It's expensive as hell, but wow. It's the future of keyboards.<br /><br />And what's Apple doing on this front? Perhaps making an <a title=\"Apple OLED Keyboard Patent\" href=\"http://gizmodo.com/340054/apple-files-patent-for-oled-dynamic-keyboard-awaits-angry-letter-from-lebedev\" target=\"_blank\">Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) keyboard of their own</a>. Will it be cheaper than the Optimus Maximus? Probably. Will Art.Lebedev Studios, creator of the Optimus and other wonderful and expensive design goodies, sue Apple? This might be a story we hear more about next year.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I've been thinking lately about news readers. I use <a href=\"http://www.newsgator.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NetNewsWire</a> on my Mac and my iPhone. It's a good reader, and I've grown to depend on the automated syncing of my feeds between my desktop and phone. I, like many people, only sync 'must read' items to my iPhone. My Mac client is where I download all of my subscribed feeds.</p>\n<div class=\"infobox\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>As an aside, here's how to selectively sync your feeds if you use NetNewsWire. <strong>The hard way</strong>: You get to these settings by logging into your account (assuming you've created one) at www.newsgator.com. Then you choose 'Settings,' then 'Edit Locations.' From here, you can choose which feeds to track on which platform, among many other options. It takes some work to set up initially, but I find it's useful to only sync selected feeds to my iPhone in the interest of bandwidth. <strong>The easier way</strong>: Fire up NNW on your iPhone or Touch, then select a feed title. Choose 'Edit.' Then choose 'Delete.' This will bring up an option to unsubscribe from the feed everywhere, or just not sync it to the mobile device. Much simpler.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>What I've been thinking about is the creeping tyranny of my feed reader. I've found that I've become quite feed-complacent. I have a large set of feeds that I routinely read, and the feed reader saves me time. That's the purpose of a feed reader, right? But over time, I've found that I don't surf around like I used to. <br /><br />I tend to prefer my feed reader because it's so fast and easy. The result is that I've been reading the same feeds for quite some time, and I find that I rarely add new feeds these days. As I track a lot of mac-related feeds, I've found that it's a bit of an echo chamber. The same posts appear over and over, and it's relatively rare to find something new that hasn't yet been reported on in ten other places.<br /><br />It seems to me that I used to find a lot of hidden gems by randomly roaming the web. I don't do that as much these days, but I'm going to start exploring again. The internet is a vast place, so there really isn't a good reason to get complacent. <br /><br />A good tool to break out of the tyranny of the same-old-feeds is <a href=\"http://www.stumbleupon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">StumbleUpon</a>. If you've never used it, it's worth a look.<br /><br />The advantage of this service as opposed to, say, random web searching, is that you can select a subset of categories that interest you. Then, when you have a few spare moments and feel like exploring, you click the Stumble button (I use a <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/138\" target=\"_blank\">FireFox toolbar</a>) and are taken to a randomized site that falls somewhere within the range of the site categories that interest you. Sometimes the sites suck. Sometimes the sites are magnificent.<br /><br />The one thing that is certain is that the service will take you to sites you may have never otherwise encountered. As a blogger, I'm often looking for something new and interesting to comment on, or looking for an interesting site or idea to share. This service is a great idea generator. It's also a good way to enjoy yourself as you explore the web ... and rediscover why it's called the World Wide Web. <br /><br />So this is a call (to myself, really) to break away from the news reader more often and surf. And it's a call to refresh my feeds more often. There's a lot of content out there waiting to be discovered.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://vfd.troykitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/img1.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f11fce4b0b2818fdccaa2/1282610832084/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Spectrum of PIM\" width=\"500\" height=\"123\" /></a> <br /><br />Long ago, I began an information organizer review series. I started out strong. I posted a nice little <a href=\"/2008/05/02/mac-pim-review-part-i/\">intro</a> piece. I knocked out the <a href=\"/2008/05/09/mac-pim-review-ii-yojimbo-review/\">first review</a> in the series. Then it utterly unraveled for two reasons. <br /><br />First, Alan over at <a href=\"http://alan.petitepomme.net/blog/\">Metadata</a> weighed in that VodooPad shouldn't be in my review group (which included Yojimbo, DEVONThink, Together, and EagleFiler).<br /><br />He followed up that thought with a <a href=\"http://alan.petitepomme.net/blog/2008/05/data-organizers-vs-data-creato.html\">post on his blog</a> in which he suggested we divide <em>info organizers</em> into two distinct categories: those that help us <strong>organize existing data</strong>, and those that help us <strong>create new data</strong> (or, as he restated at the end of his post: \"<strong>creators let you manipulate data, whereas organizers let you manipulate metadata</strong>\").<br /><br />It's a great article, and the foundation for this post. I agree with much of what he said, but as you'll see, my model differs a bit from his. <br /><br />I've concluded he was right about VooDooPad: you <em>can</em> organize existing documents with it, in the same way you can use Word to store a list of all of the books you own. But why would you? Other apps are far better suited for the task. <br /><br />So, as I was pondering this, I was offered a new job. And that's the second reason for the long delay. As I've mentioned here many times now, I moved. I'm still recovering (and unpacking). <br /><br />Now I'd like to resume the discussion. This is an attempt to build upon Alan's post by proposing that we present organizer apps on a spectrum. I want to reemphasize that, in the spirit of collaboration, this draws heavily on the ideas from Alan's post. Go read <a href=\"http://alan.petitepomme.net/blog/2008/05/data-organizers-vs-data-creato.html\">that</a> first. <br /><br />So here it is. There are three main categories of info organizer applications that form the spectrum of PIM:</p>\n<h3>1. Finders</h3>\n<p>These applications strive to serve up something better than Apple's Finder to archive, organize, and search through your important documents. Apps in this category tend to focus on giving you powerful metadata tools to help you find what you need and organize your existing documents/files (thanks, Alan). Examples are Leap, PathFinder, EagleFiler, Together, DEVONThink.</p>\n<h3>2. Creators</h3>\n<p>These apps focus on providing a better notebook experience. They provide a central repository to create and collect notes, ideas, snippets, multimedia clips, and (to a lesser extent) existing documents. Simple interfaces, quick entry, and rapid search are emphasized. Examples are Yojimbo, Evernote, Notebook, VooDooPad</p>\n<h3>3. Visualizers</h3>\n<p>These applications focus on providing a better creative space in which to help you plan projects and gain insight into your data. Examples are Curio, Tinderbox, OmniOutliner<br /><br /> <a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1201e4b0b2818fdccaa5/1282610832074/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f11fde4b0b2818fdccaa3/1282610832767/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DEVONthink's place on the spectrum\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a> Since many of the functions of these applications overlap each other, I think it's helpful to view them on a spectrum. We can then perhaps get a better sense of where on the spectrum a given app fits. The screenshot on the right, for example, shows where I think DEVONthink fits on the continuum.</p>\n<h3>The fine print</h3>\n<p><br />Now a word about info organizers, info managers, PIM, or whatever you want to call these kinds of apps. I've had so many people ask for recommendations on applications that fall in the info organizer realm. I think there are no clear answers. Part of the problem is also a great strength of the Mac platform: the glut of third party app choices. And part of the problem is that many of us aren't really sure what we want.  <br /><br />The explanations (read: marketing) provided by many Mac 'info management' apps don't help much. So there it is: we have too many choices, the essential functions of these choices are not well enough defined, and the reason the definitions are broad and vague is because the apps themselves offer solutions to a very wide range of info organizational problems. <br /><br />Some organize existing data, some help create new data, some help visualize connections amongst data ... and most do all of these things to some degree. <br /><br />We know that most (or, at least, the best) info organizers do a lot more: they help us find things more quickly, make connections between disparate items, and come up with new ideas. They aim to help us solve uniquely modern problems: to fight information overload, to cut through clutter, to combine the super powerful with the super simple interface, to help us make unforeseen connections, and to serve as a nesting place or (better yet) breeding ground for our thoughts. <br /><br />If we have a glut of PIM apps, it's because we have a real need to manage the wash of information that is cluttering our lives. With our computers serving as the repository for all of our info, data, thoughts ... we clearly need to find a way to pull it all together. To make it perform for us. That's the new paradigm. Some focus on organization, some on creating new info, and some focus most on tying together all stuff into some sort of coherent package so we can find our way forward. <br /><br />Which you choose will depend on what you need. Ultimately, I think the winners will not necessarily be the ones that pull all of these elements together in one application. Rather, I think there is room enough for lots of variety. Our challenge, then, is to pick the right apps to do the job, but to pick the ones that do the job in a way that is natural for us.  While it's true there may be too many options out there right now, that's the nature of competition. The best ones usually stand the test of time. <br /><br />I plan to use the spectrum framework as I return to reviewing some specific applications. In the spirit of choosing apps that clearly fall within a 'band' of the spectrum, my review choices will change from the <a href=\"/compare-5-info-managers/\">original lineup</a> (I'm still deciding which ones I want to tackle). <br /><br />When I'm done, I'm considering placing all the major info organizer apps (not just the ones I reviewed) on the spectrum with the aim of helping people sort through all of the choices.<br /><br />I'll close with a word on the acronym PIM and the phrase 'info management.' I think they are both hopelessly broad and meaningless. Every program used on a home computer is, in a sense, a personal info manager. Sadly, I'll probably keep using PIM out of habit. After all, spectrum of PIM sounds much better than spectrum of info organizers.<br /><br />Some clever person should devise a better term. I kind of like 'personal content assistant,' used by the folks over at<a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/\"> Eastgate Tinderbox</a>. Or perhaps we could use MIP: making information perform.</p>\n",

				"title": "Catching Up, Lessons Learned",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Well, I'm happy to say the move is over. Before I recap some of my technology-oriented 'lessons learned' during this period of transition, I'd like to respond to some of the comments received over the past couple of months while I was not monitoring this site:<br /><br />1. Reader <a href=\"http://www.biopesticide.ucr.edu/\">Lek</a> asked how to convert (or move) a site from Rapidweaver to WordPress. The only way I am aware of to do this is to manually transfer posts and comments. There are no automated ways to do it that I know of. If anyone knows of any tricks or tips in this department, please let us know.<br /><br />I did, however, come across interesting threads related to <a href=\"http://www.red-sweater.com/forums/viewtopic.php?id=477\">MarsEdit</a> and <a href=\"http://nilrogsplace.se/tutorials/wordpress/index.html\">RapidWeaver</a> that are worth checking out. Both threads relate to using RW for static content and another system (e.g. WordPress) for a blog on one site.<br /><br />2. A couple of readers commented on the current bugginess of RapidWeaver, and reader <a href=\"http://www.panicgirl.net/\">PanicGirl</a> noted the lack of ability to directly edit code in a RW blog. About the bugs: it does has some flaws, but I maintain it's about the easiest way to get a site up and running for people who don't want or need absolute control, but want quite a bit of flexiblity. And, no, you can't edit HTML directly in RW. It It may not be the best tool for those who want total control. For those who do want such control, RW templates are fully editable, but it takes a fair investment of time to learn how to do it.<br /><br />3. <a href=\"http://www.panicgirl.net/\">PanicGirl</a> also asked if <a href=\"http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/\">MarsEdit</a> is the best tool to use with WordPress, and if I'd tried <a href=\"http://www.marinersoftware.com/sitepage.php?page=85\">MacJournal</a>. MarsEdit is the best tool that I know of to manage my WP blog. It saves me countless hours. I haven't used MacJournal for a long while (in the days before it had this feature, back when it was donationware). Sounds like this would make a good future app comparison.<br /><br />4. Reader <a href=\"/2008/05/09/mac-pim-review-ii-yojimbo-review/#comment-333\">Gary</a> commented on my <a href=\"/2008/05/09/mac-pim-review-ii-yojimbo-review/\">Yojimbo</a> review, noting that worrying about potential database corruption in a SQLite database is different than actually experiencing database corruption. I haven't come across any users who actually had such corruption. My Yojimbo database has never given me any problems. Point taken.<br /><br />5. I received several new app suggestions regarding the long-delayed Mac PIM review series (which I started before the move, then was forced to abandon because of the move). I'm still scratching my head a bit over the Info Manager comparison idea. All of the suggested applications are certainly worthy of review, so my challenge now is to regroup and decide how I want to tackle this comparison in the coming months.<br /><br />To recap, I began a comparison between five info management apps back in May(!), but have only completed a full review of <a href=\"/2008/05/09/mac-pim-review-ii-yojimbo-review/\">Yojimbo</a> to date. I floundered for a while, too, on just which apps I should choose for this series. I think I may opt for more reviews, but markedly shorter reviews for each app. I'd like to spend more time discussing the range and categorization of info managers to help place them in better context, which will hopefully help to sift through the sea of choices out there for the Mac. The term 'Personal Info Manager' really doesn't cut it, as fellow blogger <a href=\"http://alan.petitepomme.net/blog/2008/05/data-organizers-vs-data-creato.html\">Alan</a> aptly pointed out in a post on his <a href=\"http://alan.petitepomme.net/blog/\">site</a>. Stay tuned for more on this. This topic has become a minor obsession.<br /><br />6. Some other readers took the time to post some nice comments on various reviews on the site, to which I say 'thank you.' And I thank all readers for their patience during this long offline period. Curiously, my RSS subscriber base actually increased over the past two months, despite the dearth of new material. Go figure.</p>\n<h3>About the Move</h3>\n<p>Now for a few words about my move from Hawaii to Maryland. I spent the better portion of the past two months without internet access, and without my desktop Mac. Fortune smiled on me, though: right before I moved from Hawaii, a friend upgraded to the 3G iPhone and graciously gave me his 16GB 1st generation iPhone for a pittance. I've always used employer-provided cell phones, so this was the first time I actually had my own mobile device.<br /><br />I can't stress how useful the iPhone has been during this period with no home, no easy internet access, and no computer. Here's what I took away from the experience:<br /><br />1. My next Mac will be a Macbook Pro. I love my 24-inch iMac, but I'm now ready to sell it. Since the thing I love most about my current desktop is the large display, I will buy an affordable large display and will dock my laptop while working at home. It's a much more expensive solution, but it's worth it.<br /><br />2. The iPhone Google Maps application is incredible. The cell tower triangulation employed by my 2G iPhone worked unexpectedly well. We used Maps more than any other single application during the move to get directions to potential new rental homes, to find nearby stores, and to figure out where we were. Transitioning from Oahu's few roadways to the serpentine routes of suburban DC has been jarring.<br /><br />3. I missed the ability to update my podcasts. The iPhone needs the ability to download casts on the fly, without the need to tether up to iTunes. Judging from Apple's unfriendly and illogical response to the <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/apples-capricious-app-policy/\">first iPhone app to offer this service</a>, I guess we won't get this functionality any time soon. That's a shame. As many have already noted around the Macosphere, Apple's bizarre and murky iPhone application acceptance/denial policies (coupled with their lack of transparency) threaten to dissuade developers from making great apps. This anticompetitive streak is sad to see. Excellent, inventive third party apps are the soul of the iPhone platform, just as they are the soul of the Mac.<br /><br />4. Cultured Code's <a href=\"http://www.culturedcode.com/things/iphone/\">Things</a> for the iPhone worked well for me, but I wonder why it doesn't include the 'Areas' feature of the desktop app. Nevertheless, I relied on it to manage dozens upon dozens of tasks, and it held up beautifully. I was a bit surprised to see that Things 1.0 (desktop) now isn't due out until the Fall, but at least we have a very good Beta. Odd, though, that Things for the iPhone rolled out for $9.99 right from the start.<br /><br />5. <a href=\"http://evernote.com/\">Evernote's</a> iPhone app also served us well. We used this app to store all of our critical data (airplane, hotel, and car reservation confirmations, etc.) for quick and easy access. I have no real complaints about it. It did what I needed it to do. Still, I would love to see <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/Yojimbo/\">Yojimbo</a> compete in this arena. I'm not willing to shell out $30 for the limited functionality of <a href=\"http://flyingmac.com/webjimbo/\">Webjimbo</a>.<br /><br />6. Agile Web Solution's <a href=\"http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password\">1Password</a> did the job, but I was a bit frustrated by the way it opens up links within the application. I prefer to use mobile Safari. I actually think I liked the first iteration of 1Password (the web-based solution) more than I do the full-scale iPhone app, simply because I often surf to a site in Safari, then realize I need a password. In such a case, it's inconvenient to have to exit Safari, start up 1Password, then load the page again within 1Password.<br /><br />7. The AT&amp;T network is surprisingly spotty. In our new home, I can't get a decent signal ... yet my wife can get a great signal on her cheap T-Mobile pay-as-you-go phone. I expected the iPhone to have a better signal in most locations, but that hasn't been my experience.<br /><br />8. I downloaded <a href=\"http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password\">WordPress</a> for the iPhone before I packed up my desktop, but I have yet to use it. The problem is one of ease of use: I just can't see myself typing a post on that little touchscreen. I'm awaiting a bluetooth-enabled mini keyboard.<br /><br />9. I'd like to add my voice to the choir regarding the lack of <em>cut and paste</em> on the iPhone. It's a basic, essential feature and I'm dumbfounded that we still don't have it at version 2.1.<br /><br />That's about it for now. It's good to be back.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Today is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ides_of_March\" target=\"_blank\">Ides of March</a>, the day of Julius Caesar's untimely demise in 44 B.C. What's does this have to do with the Mac? <br /><br />Well, I first thought of Caesar. Then I thought of Colleen McCullough's excellent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_Rome\" target=\"_blank\">Masters of Rome</a> historical fiction series, which I recently finished reading. That got me thinking about books in general. Then I thought about <a href=\"http://www.delicious-monster.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Delicious Library</a> and <a href=\"http://www.librarything.com\" target=\"_blank\">LibraryThing</a>, two excellent bookish tools you can use on your Mac. Hence, this post.</p>\n<h3>Delicious Library</h3>\n<p><a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1172e4b0b2818fdcc932/1282610468363/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1172e4b0b2818fdcc930/1282610468033/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Delicious Library\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.delicious-monster.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Delicious Library</a>, from Delicious Monster, is a cataloguing tool that is perhaps the most ingenious use of the Mac's built-in iSight I've seen. Scan the barcodes of your books with your iSight (or any webcam or connected FireWire digital video camera) to create a digital catalog. Then browse through your new digital collection. You can synch up your catalog with your iPod, print out your catalog, and get personalized recommendations based on your collection. If you regularly lend out your books to friends, you can use the tool's loan management system to keep track of who has what. I can't put my finger on it, but I find it oddly enjoyable to scan barcodes on my Mac. Beyond being fun to use, it's a great inventory tool.</p>\n<h3>LibraryThing</h3>\n<p><a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1172e4b0b2818fdcc933/1282610468217/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f1172e4b0b2818fdcc931/1282610468023/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"LibraryThing\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.librarything.com\" target=\"_blank\">LibraryThing</a> is a web-based social 'book club' with a user-based catalogue of 24,000,000 books and growing. Wow. Create a free account to get started, enter some books from your library, write a book review, join a discussion group, get some recommendations based on your catalog. You can choose to add just a few books that you most recently read, or enter your entire library (if you enter more than 200 books, you will need to pay a modest fee). Or just surf around to see what others are reading. I could spend days on <a href=\"http://www.librarything.com/zeitgeist\" target=\"_blank\">this page</a> alone. The strength of this tool is its depth of information: pick a title and check out the <strong>book info</strong> and <strong>social info</strong> pages to see what I mean. I don't think you'll find better, non-commercial info about a book anywhere on the web. If you really like books, you owe it to yourself to check this out. It's a great discovery tool.</p>\n<h3>More Connections</h3>\n<p>By the way, the series of connections that led to this post led me to think of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burke_(science_historian)\" target=\"_blank\">James Burke</a>. I used to love reading his Connections column in Scientific American (he is probably most well-known for his excellent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connections_%28TV_series%29\" target=\"_blank\">BBC television series</a>). Burke specializes in tracing the interconnectivity of things: how events and inventions in the distant past lead up to the modern day. The connections he makes can be surprising (an example from the TV series: Burke shows how a test of gold&rsquo;s purity 2500 years ago leads to the atomic bomb).<br /><br />Check out the James Burke Institute <a href=\"http://www.k-web.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Knowledge Web</a> project &mdash; I've had this site bookmarked for years awaiting it's <a href=\"http://k-web.org/public_html/news.htm\" target=\"_blank\">launch</a>. From the Knowledge Web site: <em>\"it will soon be an interactive space on the web where students, teachers, and other knowledge seekers can explore information in a highly interconnected, holistic way that allows for an almost infinite number of paths of exploration among people, places, things, and events.\"</em><br /></p>\n",

This is the classic '<em>give away the razor and charge a premium for the razor blades</em>' marketing model: you get the free software, but to use it you will need to buy custom Avery packages to cram into your inkjet printer.<br /><br />Of course, I had to try it.<br /><br />First, some discussion about the software package is warranted. To get it, you must register. I always find this a bit off-putting, but I dove right it. Hey, it's free. Then I proceeded to the download, which is a jarringly-large 232 MB file. This worried me somewhat. Why on earth was it so large? Proceeding to the installation, my worries grew apace. You put this package on your system via an installer that requires your admin password, which is indication that it's (at a minimum) going to put stuff in your main Library folder. Ok, but what's going to go there? I proceeded with the install, expecting some sort of indicator of what it installed and where it put it. I got nothing of the sort.<br /><br />In an attempt to figure out where all those megabytes went (the app itself is only 8 MB!), I used <a href=\"http://www.appzapper.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AppZapper</a>, a great little uninstaller program that gets rid of all the odds and ends a program typically leaves behind. This is a lazy method I sometime use to see what is installed where for a given package. When you drop a program into the AppZapper target window, it lists all of the program components it will uninstall (including the path of the files).<br /><br />When I did this for DesignPro, however, it only found about 8MB of data to uninstall: a preference file and the main application from the app folder. Ok...so where were the hundreds of megabytes of data I just installed? I suspect that this is not the fault of AppZapper; my guess is that it's tied to the unique installation process of Avery DesignPro.<br /><br />I then completely deleted the program and reinstalled it, hoping to get some clues from the DesignPro installer by paying closer attention this time around. Alas, it was to no avail. The only noteworthy option I could find in the installation process was a '<strong>customize</strong>' prompt within the installer. This option presented me with three choices (meaning I could choose to install or not install three different components by checking a box). The choices: the DesignPro application, a QuickLook plug in, and 'resource files.' No path information was presented. Oddly, each selection displayed as 0 bytes in size regardless of whether the box was checked or not. And there was no indication of what the 'resource files' were and if I really needed them. Not too helpful.   <a class=\"alignright\" rel=\"sslightbox\" href=\"http://static.squarespace.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f11d9e4b0b2818fdcca59/1282610745547/#img.jpg.com/static/501f04b6c4aaff0be5e7475c/501f115ae4b0b2818fdcc6d9/501f11d9e4b0b2818fdcca58/1282610745603/1000w\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Avery DesignPro\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a> <br /><br />Finally, after the reinstall, I decided to manually search through my <strong>Library</strong> folders to discover where the application installed its bits and peices (Spotlight, in case you're wondering, did not offer up any clues about the locations of the mystery files...although, in retrospect, I suspect it would have if I had refreshed the index).<br /><br />Turns out that this app installs in a few locations: your main <strong>Library</strong> in a folder called <strong>DesignPro</strong> (which contains about 318 MB of data) and in your user account <strong>Library</strong> in a folder called <strong>DesignPro</strong> (which is about 7 MB). The user account library contains a sqlite database, by the way. I'm not sure what the app is storing there, though. I created a few labels and saved them, and the sqlite database remained the exact same size.<br /><br />When you create a project and save it, it is placed by default in your documents folder. And if you open up your projects, it opens up in the app as expected. I tried out QuickLook on one of these documents, and it does present a preview of the project as advertised.<br /><br />The moral of the story is this: if you want to delete this application completely, there is an entry in your main <strong>Library</strong> and your user account <strong>Library</strong> labeled '<strong>DesignPro</strong>.' There is a preference (<strong>plist</strong>) file located in your user account <strong>Preferences</strong> folder, as expected. And there is the main application in your <strong>Applications</strong> folder. I thought this would be handy to pass on since the data that AppZapper missed was over 300 MB in size).<br /><br />Most of that data is nothing more than templates and clip art. It would be nice to have a choice to NOT install this 'extra' stuff. I suspect this alone would decrease this very large package down to a much more reasonable 20 MB or so. I would also prefer the option to install this app in one user account only. I don't want to install it system-wide.<br /><br />One thing is certain: if I start to experience weird system behavior and bugginess, at least I know where to start. My first step will be to delete this app.<br /><br />At any rate, DesignPro seems to work just fine so far.<br /><br />So what does it do? It helps you create labels of every imaginable shape and size, business cards, name badges, cards, T-shirts, CD/DVD labels, photo badges and more. You can choose from what appears to be about million Avery templates and create a quick design from a template (or create your own design). There are, in fact, over 1,300 template designs and over 2,000 clip art files from which you may choose.<br /><br />DesignPro handily allows for data merging from Apple Mail and Address Book. It allows you to import images from iPhoto and import playlist data from iTunes for media projects. My initial take is that this is a full-featured product that may come in very handy for designing and printing simple projects using Avery standard labels. As someone who does not use MS Word (I use Pages), it's a welcome addition to quickly create mailing labels, badges, or other sticky-backed print jobs with ease.<br /><br />Having said that, I would not say that this is the easy-to-use and intuitive Mac user experience claimed by Avery. It will take some getting used to. The user interface is odd. It has the weird feel of a ported Windows application haphazardly mixed with only a few familiar Mac OS elements and controls. It is confusing. It is also packed to the rafters will gratuitous clip art, templates and special effect options which are hauntingly reminiscent of low-cost commercial print packages I recall from my Windows days. But, hey, it is free and it does do the job. It's worth a look.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<h3>1. Things integration, tagging</h3>\n<p><a title=\"Things\" href=\"http://culturedcode.com/things/\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/192acfc625.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Things\" width=\"100\" height=\"85\" /></a><br />Cultured Code's <a href=\"http://culturedcode.com/things/\" target=\"_blank\">Things</a> is slowly and methodically nearing release &mdash; something I suspect many people eagerly await (or not, considering we now get to use the Beta for free!). Last saturday, Cultured Code released a small version update with a big new feature: <a href=\"http://culturedcode.com/things/blog/2008/05/things-092-brings-support-for-leopards-system-wide-to-do-service.html\" target=\"_blank\">system-wide To Do integration</a>. Enter a To Do in Things, and it's instantly in Mail and iCal. It's a significant step in the evolution of this task manager. It's been enlightening to watch this app progress via the updates and the Things <a href=\"http://culturedcode.com/things/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a>. The developers are clearly focusing an extraordinary level of effort to get this right, and it shows. I can't wait to see the companion app for the iPhone/iPod Touch due out at the end of June.<br /><br />I received a <a href=\"/2008/02/04/gtd-based-task-management-apps-v-things/#comment-279\">comment</a> this week concerning my original (and aging) <a href=\"/2008/02/04/gtd-based-task-management-apps-v-things/\">Things review</a>. I questioned the scalability of Things in that review (i.e. ability to manage hundreds of To Dos), and reader Mark countered that Things scales just fine provided one develops a good tagging system. I think this is largely true &mdash; more so as I've become a better tag manager and better versed in how to use Things.<br /><br />The trick, then, is to develop a system of tagging that works. If you have a good tagging structure for Things, you can share it on the Things wiki (on the<a href=\"http://culturedcode.com/things/wiki/index.php?title=Real-world_tagging_examples\" target=\"_blank\"> Real-world tagging examples</a> page). There are two useful entries there to help get you started. Hopefully more tagging gurus will share their ideas and solutions. For more on tagging, check out Ian Beck's <a href=\"http://tagamac.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TagaMac</a> site (particularly his <a href=\"http://tagamac.com/intro/\" target=\"_blank\">intro to tags</a>).<br /><br />By the way, wouldn't it be nice to have a dedicated wiki for community-contributed tagging solutions, usage examples, and tips for all Mac apps that support the venerable tag?</p>\n<h3>2. RapidWeaver 4 first impressions</h3>\n<p><a title=\"RapidWeaver 4\" href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/2b4aefe302.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"RapidWeaver 4\" width=\"100\" height=\"85\" /></a><br />You may have heard that RealMac Software's <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RapidWeaver 4</a> came out this week. The most noticeable difference in this Leopard-only upgrade is the user interface, but there are also some significant under-the-hood improvements. If you are upgrading from an earlier version, ensure you update your third party plug ins first, then install the upgrade.<br /><br />The new interface meshes well with the 'Leopard look' and is sleeker and easier to look at. It also includes a far amount of eye candy (e.g. black pop up windows, iconic representations of your files flying past during file open and upload). In short, it looks good. Note to RapidWeaver: I don't need to see each file loading when I start up RW. Just show me the progress bar. All those file icons whipping past is a nice use of Core Animation, but it's superfluous. Same goes for the file upload progress indicator.<br /><br />I like the new toolbar that runs across the top of the app. At first, I was lamenting that I could not customize the shortcuts on the toolbar. Then, upon further inspection, it dawned on me that everything I need is already there. Good design.<br /><br />The left-hand sidebar icons that represent individual pages of your site are now easier to recognize. RW pages are easy to pick out, as are third party plugin pages (e.g. a Blocks page now looks, appropriately, like a big yellow block).<br /><br />One thing I don't like is the '<strong>Add a new Page</strong>' view in the UI &mdash;  it looks pretty, but I can't see the version number of my plugins as I could in earlier versions of the app (I tried clicking on the plugin name, as I would in Finder to reveal a long file name, but this had no effect). This used to be an easy way to see if I had the most current plugins installed.<br /><br />There are now four new themes. You can now search through your themes or filter them (based on RW version, or if they originated from a third party). I like this. The one minor problem I've noticed is this: if I change the theme view to display smaller icon sizes, it doesn't stick. Once I close the document and open it up again, the theme previews are once again set to the default size (which are a bit too large).<br /><br />One of the biggest changes is the adoption of a new file format based on standard XML. This is good news for people with very large sites, and good news for third party integration possibilities. I can vouch for this: publishing is dramatically speedier.<br /><br />Be sure to check out the new Extras folder in the download. It includes a well-designed new PDF manual, the SDK for Theme development, and an assortment of web badges to add to your site.<br /><br />I'm quite happy with this update, although I could not find a changelog anywhere on the RW site that clearly delineates what's new. I'm sure it's there somewhere.<br /><br />And speaking of the RW <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, it also received a major refresh (RealMac does this with each major release, offering up their previous site design as a new RW template).<br /><br />The RapidWeaver <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/forums/index.php/forums/\" target=\"_blank\">forums</a> have also been totally revamped. There is now a main community discussion section, a technical support section (which is now the primary means to get technical support for RW), and community forums in various languages other than English. A note for people who were used to the old forum: look for the search function inside the categories. It looks good, but I was disappointed to see that my account indicates that I've not made any posts (i.e. it appears my account was reset with the new launch. I don't know if other users face the same situation).</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>If you've been following the <a href=\"/compare-5-info-managers/\">PIM series</a> here, you know that I recently <a href=\"/2008/05/18/pim-review-delay/\">delayed my reviews</a> because the Worldwide Developers Conference is just around the corner (a time of year when many Mac apps are updated). But I have a confession to make. This delay is also a convenient excuse! I haven't had time to devote my energies to the PIM review series over the past couple of weeks, and this offered a valid reason to postpone. With the recent update of two of the five apps in this review series (Together and EagleFiler), I plan to be back with the next review soon. I may change the order of the reviews and start with the recently-updated apps as a precaution.<br /><br />Speaking of the PIM reviews, there has been an interesting development regarding this series: Alan Schmitt of <a href=\"http://alan.petitepomme.net/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata</a> posted a very well-thought out <a href=\"http://alan.petitepomme.net/blog/2008/05/data-organizers-vs-data-creato.html\">argument</a> that VooDooPad shouldn't be part of this review series since it's a fundamentally different sort of application. Alan makes a distinction between PIMs as data organizers and PIMs as data creation tools: while the former is focused on manipulation of metadata, the latter is focused on manipulation of data. I think this is an excellent point. What I'm thinking about now is how the various Mac info managers fit on the creation vs. organization spectrum. I'll post my thoughts soon.<br /><br />Meanwhile, here's a short round up of odds and ends that recently caught my interest around the Macosphere.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>1. Get Satisfaction</h3>\n<p><a title=\"Get Satisfaction\" href=\"http://getsatisfaction.com/\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/c75763c2b9.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Get Satisfaction\" width=\"100\" height=\"85\" /></a><br /><a href=\"http://getsatisfaction.com/\">Get Satisfaction</a> is a community-driven customer service site with an aim to create new and better connections between companies and users. It's a place to get tech support, a place to gripe about a product or service, a place to interact with employees from a company, and a place to share ideas. For companies, it's a great way to manage tech support and directly engage with customers (and it's free). For customers like you and me, it's a very interactive and interesting way to get help with an app or service (or just to monitor what people are saying). I also like the newly-added '<a href=\"http://getsatisfaction.com/for_companies/overheard\" target=\"_blank\">Overheard</a>' feature on Get Satisfaction, which allows companies to track what people are saying about them in the Twittersphere. It's an interesting way to view a narrow segment of Twitter posts. It's also a novel way to generate tips and ideas for posts for bloggers (for instance, I can monitor the worldwide Twitter stream of all posts that mention Apple). I have the sense that Get Satisfaction is a harbinger of things to come as social networking/microblogging evolves and matures. It's a great tool that is worth your time to check out. Let's count down the days until it's bought by Google.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>2. Alternative Twitter Views</h3>\n<p><a title=\"twittervision\" href=\"http://twittervision.com/\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/cdde7a56e7.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"twittervision\" width=\"100\" height=\"85\" /></a><br />I'm still adjusting to the Twitter phenomenon. The best description of it I've heard so far comes from Adam Christianson of the <a href=\"http://www.maccast.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MacCast</a>, who noted it's like iChat without the commitment. I like that. At any rate, here are a couple of interesting sites that provide alternative views of the Twitter stream. The first, <a href=\"http://twittervision.com/\" target=\"_blank\">twittervision</a>, is a mash-up of Google Maps and Twitter. As you might expect, it displays Twitter posts in realtime on a world map. The second, <a href=\"http://firehose.stamen.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Firehose</a>, presents a realtime Twitter timeline. These sites aren't particularly useful, but they are interesting. The Firehose stream is particularly mesmerizing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>3. Delicious Library 2 Nears Release</h3>\n<p><a title=\"Delicious Library\" href=\"http://www.delicious-monster.com/\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/1b8b60f6de.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Delicious Library\" width=\"100\" height=\"85\" /></a><br />The developer of <a href=\"http://www.delicious-monster.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Delicious Library</a>, the barcode-friendly media cataloguing tool, announced the availability of a Beta download of version 2.0 yesterday via a <a href=\"http://twitter.com/wilshipley/statuses/818676516\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter post</a>. If you buy the current version of DL (1.6.6), you will get the 2.0 upgrade for free. If you've never tried DL, download the trial and check it out. It's the slickest use of the built-in iSight camera that I've seen. Note that the 2.0 Beta is optimized for OS X Leopard 10.5.3, which has not yet been released.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>4. Ready-Set-Do! GTD App Updated</h3>\n<p><a title=\"Ready-Set-Do!\" href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/toddvasquez/Ready-Set-Do!/Personal93.html\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/531e33d435.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Ready-Set-Do!\" width=\"100\" height=\"85\" /></a><br /><a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/toddvasquez/Ready-Set-Do!/Personal93.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ready-Set-Do!</a>, a Getting Things Done workflow app, updated to 1.3 recently. This isn't as much an application as it is a cleverly packaged set of Applescripts that allow you to manage the files on your Mac using GTD methodology. From what I've read, this app is for people who really grok the GTD process. It appears to be most similar to <a href=\"/2008/01/28/gtd-based-task-management-apps-iv-midnight-inbox/\" target=\"_blank\">Midnight Inbox</a>, in that it aims to serve as a GTD command post to manages all the files on your Mac by creating alias links (in other words, files are not actually moved around, they are only referenced and managed through the Ready-Set-Do! interface). Interesting idea.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>5. Links for web developers</h3>\n<p><a title=\"blogwell's Top 100 Resources for Web Developers\" href=\"http://blog-well.com/2008/03/04/100-resources-for-web-developers/\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/3948a0e355.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"blogwell's Top 100 Resources for Web Developers\" width=\"100\" height=\"85\" /></a><br />I'm kind of tired of 'top ten' style lists, but blogwell.com's <a href=\"http://blog-well.com/2008/03/04/100-resources-for-web-developers/\" target=\"_blank\">100+ Resources for Web Developers</a> is a good reference and summary.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>6. Graffletopia</h3>\n<p>If you use OmniGraffle, you must check out <a href=\"http://www.graffletopia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Graffletopia</a>. Here, you can choose from over 300,000 free stencils to use in your <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/OmniGraffle/\" target=\"_blank\">OmniGraffle</a> project. <a title=\"Graffletopia\" href=\"http://www.graffletopia.com/\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/be20eda490.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Graffletopia\" width=\"100\" height=\"85\" /></a>If you're unfamiliar with OmniGraffle, it's a tool with which you can create diagrams. If you peruse through some of the Graffletopia styles, you will quickly get a sense of just how useful this tool can be.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Here's a project idea for the long weekend. Have you heard of scanner art? The basic idea is this: you scan things and you try to make something something artistic with it. Is it art? Is it really photography? Some say yes, some say no.

Intrigued, I started experimenting with my scanner. I don't have any sage advice about creating scanned artwork, but I do have a few tips:</p>\n<blockquote>&bull; Ensure you clean the scanner bed really well before you scan<br />&bull; Be prepared to spend several hours cleaning up dust and artifacts from each image you scan with your image editor of choice (even if you DO clean the bed well, you will spend a good deal of time on this task).<br />&bull; I prefer to scan in the dark with the lid of the scanner open. It produces nice clean lines and a black background, which makes it easier to extract the image.<br />&bull; This is a great way to experiment with your image editing program (I use Photoshop), particularly for creating interesting backgrounds, arrangements and frames.<br />&bull; Try scanning anything and everything. For items that might damage your scanner bed glass, some say to try using a transparent film (e.g. a rigid piece of clear plastic of the type used to protect business reports in days past). Haven't tried this myself &mdash; I just use the 'be really, really careful when scanning' method.<br />&bull; Try playing around with arrangement and layering of your scanned items.<br />&bull; Scan the same item from different angles, then try piecing it together the various images into one montage.<br />&bull; Scan the same item at different resolutions, then try assembling something interesting from these scans.</blockquote>\n<p><br />If scanning objects appeals to you, check out <a href=\"http://www.scanner-magic.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Scanner Magic</a> and <a href=\"http://www.photo-vinc.com/articles/Flatbedscanner/Flatbedscanner.html\" target=\"_blank\">Photo Vinc</a> for more tips and ideas.</p>\n",

However, I think it will stand on its own as a unique and extraordinary offering.¬†</span>\n\nWWT allows you to surf around the galaxy, seamlessly viewing stitched images from our civilization's best telescopes. Panning and zooming around the galaxy is exceptionally fluid ‚Äî faster and more immersive than other offerings I've seen. The technology behind this is Microsoft's new high-performance \"Visual Experience Engine.\"\n\nAs one not ordinarily impressed by Microsoft products, I have to say that I really like WWT. The navigation controls are easy to use. The imagery is incredible. As you're sailing along, the thumbnails along the bottom of the screen instantly update to show you what's in the neighborhood. You can change views on the fly to look at galaxies, constellations, and other formations at different wavelengths. Overall, you get a sense of where you are in the universe better than other tools I've used. One other feature that stands out: slick multimedia guided tours from experts and enthusiasts ‚Äî and you can create your own tour, too.\n\nI'm always happy to see a new, free astronomy tool for the public. This is certainly a great addition. The only bad news is that it's Windows-only.\n\nI thought I wouldn't get the chance to test this package out given the minimum system requirements to run WWT on your Mac:\n<blockquote>- Microsoft¬Æ XP SP2 (minimum), Windows¬Æ Vista¬Æ (recommended) with BootCamp\n- Mac with Intel Core 2 Duo (2.2 GHz or faster) processor recommended\n- 1 gigabyte (GB) of RAM; 2 GB RAM recommended\n- NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT graphics card with 128-MB SDRAM or recommended\n- HFS+ hard disk format (also known as Mac OS¬Æ Extended or HFS Plus) and 10 GB of available hard disk space\n- 1440 x 900 or higher-resolution monitor</blockquote>\nI don't have Windows on BootCamp, but I do have <a href=\"http://www.vmware.com/landing_pages/fusion2_beta.html\" target=\"_blank\">VMWare Fusion 2.0 Beta</a>. My Mac isn't quite 2.2 GHz. But I decided to try it out anyway. After some wrangling, I got it to work. Here's what I'm running:\n<blockquote>- MS XP Home Edition SP2 on VMWare Fusion\n- 24-inch iMac Core 2 Duo/2.16GHz/2MB RAM running Mac OS X 10.5.2\n- VMWare Fusion 2.0 Beta (Settings: 2 virtual processors, 1120 MB RAM, Accelerated 3D graphics enabled)</blockquote>\nThis worked well for me, with a few caveats: I experienced video and audio stutters when clicking on an object for 'more information' or when starting up a tour. I also found the tours played back much more smoothly (with better image quality) after I let them play through once, and then played them again. I also had to reboot after I was finished running the application through VMWare ‚Äî my Mac was quite sluggish afterwards. Not bad trade-offs, all things considered. One note: I tried cranking up the alloted RAM for my virtual Windows installation all the way up to 1830MB (VMWare's recommended max for 2GB RAM), but this did not work. I experienced severe sluggishness, probably due to memory swapping. It worked fine once I turned the RAM back to 1120MB.\n\nI would run BootCamp, but the version of Windows I own (Home Edition) is not compatible...and I don't want to buy a newer version of Windows. If you're in this camp (and your Mac is as good or better than mine), this is a working alternative if you want to try out WWT. It's worth a look. If you run Windows on BootCamp, definitely give it a try.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>This is part two of a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->seven part series<!-- raw HTML omitted --> comparing Mac Personal Information Managers. Today, I&rsquo;m going to look at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yojimbo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> version 1.5.1.</p>\n<p>As I sat down to begin this review, I pondered discussing the Yojimbo/samurai metaphor, when it struck me that the name of the company is perhaps more relevant. I had never considered why this company is called &lsquo;Bare Bones Software,&rsquo; but maybe it has something to do with a focus on creating applications that hone in on the bare essentials. It&rsquo;s just a theory, but Yojimbo certainly qualifies as bare boned: it&rsquo;s a lightweight, simple and elegant information manager.</p>\n<p>But designing a simple and elegant application is a tricky business. You need to strike a delicate balance between functionality and user configuration options. You need to seek out and destroy bells and whistles. Unnecessary bloat and clutter must be avoided at all cost. If an application gets it right, it &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->flows like water<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; (to borrow a Taoist metaphor). It feels good to use. Of course, it also works very well. Few applications meet this high standard.</p>\n<p>I think Yojimbo is on the right path, but it&rsquo;s not quite there yet.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Looking at it from the viewpoint of the user interface, Yojimbo stands out from the competition. A person who knows nothing about this app can, as advertised, jump right in and start collecting data. The user controls are standardized Apple fare, so you know what to expect. In fact, there&rsquo;s not much to say about the user interface because there&rsquo;s not much to it. It has a distinct minimalist feel to it. You have a left-hand column for organization (√† la iTunes); you have a main window that displays your library; and you have a sliding split pane in the main pane to preview a selected item in your library (just like in Apple Mail). Aside from this, there is a standard popup inspector window that may be toggled off or on to display relevant info about a particular folder or library item. You may also customize the Yojimbo toolbar by adding/deleting your favorite items.</p>\n<p>If there is any criticism to levy against the interface, it&rsquo;s that some users may pine for a few alternative layout options. Personally, I like the interface. It&rsquo;s one of the things that drew me to the program.</p>\n<p>However, the samurai metaphor doesn&rsquo;t hold up as well for me when it comes to organization, filtering and searching. It&rsquo;s quite good, but it&rsquo;s not great. I&rsquo;ll get to this in more depth soon, but first let&rsquo;s look at getting data in and out of the program.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I should add that you can also add emails, but they are only imported as bookmarks ‚Äî if you drag and drop them into the app you create a link back to the originating app (i.e. Mail). To get the actual email message text into Yojimbo, you can use this free <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AppleScript<!-- raw HTML omitted --> created by a Yojimbo developer (I use it in concert with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MailActOn<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>\n<p>AppleScript support is a strong feature of Yojimbo, by the way. A quick web search turns up many user-generated scripts free for you to try. The only problem here is that they are a bit hard to find. I wish that Bare Bones would compile user-created scripts on their site.\nIn addition to dragging and dropping files into the app, you can directly type in new notes in rich or plain text. Unique among the PIM crowd, Yojimbo also provides two built-in templates to handle password and serial number data as well, which is a nice touch. One welcome addition would be a user-defined open template (or user-created templates). For example, I would like to create a car maintenance record template with field names that I define.</p>\n<p>There are several other ways to add data besides direct input and the &lsquo;drag and drop.&rsquo; Yojimbo also offers a &lsquo;drop dock&rsquo; that integrates into any corner of your Mac screen. I put mine in the lower left-hand side of my screen and made it as transparent as possible so it doesn&rsquo;t stick out. The drop dock allows you to directly drag and drop to the main library or directly to a specific folder. I prefer this type of &lsquo;drop box&rsquo; to those that in other apps that sit directly on the desktop because I can get at it without leaving the program I&rsquo;m working in.</p>\n<p>The only minor complaint I have about the drop dock is that you have to click <!-- raw HTML omitted -->precisely<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the word &lsquo;Yojimbo&rsquo; to minimize it. If you miss the target, it stays extended. If you are an Apple Dock user, you can also drag items to the Yojimbo dock icon. This will import the item to your library, but will not allow you to add an item to a specific folder.</p>\n<p>Another way to add data is via a hotkey (F8 by default). This is my favorite feature. With Yojimbo running in the background, F8 will bring forth a quick-entry menu to import your clipboard. While this is handy, you need to know that it only handles text (a note, bookmark, password, serial number, or web archive). If you copy a file (a RTF, Doc, image file or PDF, for example), you can&rsquo;t import it with this function. If you try, what you&rsquo;ll get is an unlinked icon file representing the file type for the document. That&rsquo;s annoying. It is nice that you can directly convert a copied URL from your browser to create a web archive, though. According to the developer, Yojimbo will &lsquo;examine the clipboard, and guess what kind of item you wish to create, and will default to that editing panel.&rsquo; If Yojimbo guesses incorrectly, you can select a different item type by using keyboard shortcuts. This feature works well for me. One thing I don&rsquo;t get, though, is why the drop-down menu includes &lsquo;image&rsquo; as an item choice since this quick-entry method doesn&rsquo;t properly import images copied to the clipboard.</p>\n<p>You can also enter data into Yojimbo with AppleScripts (like the previously-mentioned Mail script). And there are user-created scripts out there that let you add special bookmarks to your web browser for one-click bookmarking or web archiving to Yojimbo. Finally, you can use the Apple Services menu to import copied text or URL direct to Yojimbo. This is handy if Yojimbo is not currently running and you want to quickly add an item or link from a given open application.</p>\n<p>With so many different options to get info into your database, Yojimbo truly makes data entry an effortless process.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The app includes ten options for &lsquo;smart&rsquo; collections (you&rsquo;ll probably be familiar with this concept from the Finder or iTunes). Smart folders are basically saved searches. With Yojimbo, you can view flagged items, recent, unsorted, untagged, archives, bookmarks, images, notes, passwords, and serial numbers. The frustrating part is that these smart folders cannot be modified in any way, nor can you create your own smart folders based on criteria of your choosing. Why not?</p>\n<p>In addition to the &lsquo;dumb&rsquo; and smart collections, Yojimbo also serves up &lsquo;Tag Collections.&rsquo; This is a smart folder that collects items based on tags you&rsquo;ve assigned to items in your library. While it&rsquo;s nice that you can choose to collect more than one tag into a tag collection (for example, you can gather all of your items tagged &lsquo;food&rsquo; and &lsquo;recipe&rsquo;), there are several major shortcomings. First, you can only create a collection based on tags. You can&rsquo;t create a more complex collection (say, all items with &lsquo;food&rsquo; tags AND all flagged AND all recent items). Next, you can only collect tags that meet ALL conditions. There is no option to choose &lsquo;ANY&rsquo; as a selection condition. This means that I can collect all items tagged &lsquo;food&rsquo; and &lsquo;recipes,&rsquo; but I can&rsquo;t collect together items that have the single tags of &lsquo;food&rsquo; or &lsquo;recipes.&rsquo; What I would like to have is robust smart folder support, similar to what I get in the Finder or in iTunes. Yojimbo is really tying our hands by not giving us more control. The last problem is that the tag collection folders you create provide no clues about what tags are being collected. The only way to tell is to open up the tag collection for editing, or to choose an item in the collection and taking a look at the tags.</p>\n<p>One final note: you can&rsquo;t drag and drop into a Smart or Tag Collection. This makes sense in that these &lsquo;folders&rsquo; really aren&rsquo;t folders at all, but are collections of items that meet certain search parameters. But wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if you could drag an item into a Tag Collection, with Yojimbo automatically appending the tag or tags for that collection to that item?\nYojimbo also offers two other ways to organize data: flagging and labeling. Flagging is a way to keep track of hot items that require follow-up, although you could assign any meaning to a flagged item. A flag can either be on or off. Chances are, you&rsquo;re already familiar with the flag from other Mac apps. Me? I don&rsquo;t use them very often. Color labeling is a common type of organizational method as well (most notably in Finder). Unlike Yojimbo&rsquo;s built-in Smart Collections, you get full control over labels. You may change the name of a label and you may choose the colors of your labels. While you can select multiple items and label them in batch, you cannot create a rule to label items based on tags. You also cannot add a color label to a folder. You can, however, search for items based on label names, which is nice (I can search for all &lsquo;work&rsquo; labels, for instance). I&rsquo;m not a big label fan (in Yojimbo or any other app), but I might use this feature more if I had the ability to create more complex custom Smart Collections (a very handy app called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hazel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a great example of how useful this can be ‚Äî and it&rsquo;s using built-in Mac OS features!).</p>\n<p>Now back to tagging. Yojimbo emphasizes tagging as a primary organization method. Indeed, tagged collections can be handy. But it&rsquo;s not good enough. And here is my biggest problem with Yojimbo: I need better tag management options. What I would like to see added is an on-the-fly tag filtering similar to what I&rsquo;ve seen in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniFocus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If Bare Bones won&rsquo;t give users the nested folder, then they might consider providing a more interactive method to filter through tags.</p>\n<p>And speaking of tags, an inspector just for tags would be handy: a place to view them, batch change them, delete them. It would also be nice if Yojimbo would label orphaned tags in this list that are no longer being used. Note that it&rsquo;s currently not possible to change or delete a tag.\nThe ultimate test of how well your data is organized is put to the test when you try and find something. One easy way to do this is use Yojimbo&rsquo;s very speedy search engine. I have no complaints in this department. You can search by any word in an item, by tag and by label. Since Yojimbo is Spotlight-enabled, you can also search straight from Spotlight even when Yojimbo&rsquo;s not opened. I love having the ability to search for certain tagged items from my Yojimbo database using Spotlight. Very handy.</p>\n<p>As for the search function <!-- raw HTML omitted -->within<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Yojimbo, it could be made better if we had that inspector pane with a list of all of our tags (what if I can&rsquo;t remember the tags I assigned?). The other way to find what you&rsquo;re looking for, of course, is via your Collections. I&rsquo;ve already talked about why this doesn&rsquo;t meet my needs. If I had full control over my smart collections, Yojimbo would be a much better tool for organizing and finding things. I would personally also like the added ability to nest folders. I know, I know&hellip;hierarchical folders are so 20th century&hellip;but many people like to manage their data this way. Yojimbo went half-way by providing folders, so why are they against providing a nested folder option for those who want it? I don&rsquo;t get it. If the idea is that you shouldn&rsquo;t really need hierarchical folders, then the developers should get rid of them entirely. I&rsquo;m all for that ‚Äî provided I get much better tagging, filtering and smart folder creat\nion capabilities.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I also need to comment briefly on how Yojimbo data is physically stored. While some PIMs store your stuff in what&rsquo;s called a flat file structure (in other words, directly in the Finder), Yojimbo stores everything in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SQLite<!-- raw HTML omitted --> database tucked away in your user library. While I&rsquo;ve never had any trouble with the database, I came across many comments on the web from people worried about corruption. If the database gets corrupted, all of your data is potentially hosed. That&rsquo;s a bit worrisome.</p>\n<p>But there&rsquo;s nothing much to worry about if you regularly back up your system. You can back up your Yojimbo database with Time Machine, in case your wondering. I came across some posts on the web suggesting it doesn&rsquo;t work, but it did for me. I tested this by deleting my entire database from my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->user&gt;Library&gt;Application Support&gt;Yojimbo folder<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, then I replaced these files with a backed-up copy from Time Machine. It restored just fine.</p>\n<p>One more thing to consider with Yojimbo is that it duplicates a file upon import. So if I drag a PDF into the application from my Documents folder, it will still be in my Documents folder. I&rsquo;ll just have an extra copy of it now stored in the Yojimbo database. I&rsquo;m not crazy about this. I could delete the origninal files, but then I&rsquo;m relying on one database to store all of my precious files. I could keep two copies (one in my Document folder, one in my Yojimbo database) but things would get confusing if you later changed something in one of those versions; they wouldn&rsquo;t be in sync. My solution: I choose to not import most of my documents into Yojimbo. I primarily use it as a digital junk drawer.</p>\n<p>Finally, I would be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention that Yojimbo supports encryption for individual items. It works great, but I wonder why Yojimbo doesn&rsquo;t have a built-in Smart Collection to view all encrypted items. A work around for this is to create a tag called &lsquo;encrypt&rsquo; for all your encrypted items, then create Tag Collection or search on that tag.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I think Yojimbo excels at grabbing data of all varieties, but I&rsquo;m less enthusiastic when it comes to finding what I&rsquo;m looking for and filtering through my data collection. As my database grows, I find it increasingly hard to keep it organized and find what I want.</p>\n<p>Still, there are many things that I really like. What I appreciate most about Yojimbo is how easy and quick it is to add new data. I&rsquo;m also quite fond of the minimalist user interface.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. Could I figure out how to use the application with minimal fuss (without documentation)?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nThe developer states that there is &lsquo;no learning curve.&rsquo; I found this to be largely true, but there are a few features you may not discover if you don&rsquo;t read the instructions. When you first launch Yojimbo, by the way, Bare Bones includes a helpful note that summarizes all the big ideas about how to use the app.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nYes, but I&rsquo;m growing less enthusiastic as my database grows larger. I&rsquo;m particularly frustrated that I can&rsquo;t create more complex smart folders. I also would like to see more robust tagging support.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nVery well. In addition to the variety of data entry methods I detailed in this review, Yojimbo supports .Mac syncing for other Yojimbo installations on your network (and you can use your one license to install Yojimbo on multiple Macs in your household!). Yojimbo data is also spotlight indexed. This means you can search from spotlight on a tag name, and all of your Yojimbo items that match that tag will pop up (Yojimbo does not need to be running to use this). Super. By the way, if you want to access your Yojimbo database remotely (from a web browser or on your iPhone), a company called Flying Mac sells a slick Web 2.0 app called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Webjimbo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to meet this need. The downside? It will cost you an additional $30.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. How did the program &lsquo;feel?&rsquo; How &lsquo;Mac-like&rsquo; is it?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nThis application has a great feel to it. The controls are intuitive. It&rsquo;s sleek. And if you want to know how Mac-like it is, consider this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple article<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>Yojimbo is not perfect, but it&rsquo;s a reliable, speedy and handy tool in my toolbox. I think Bare Bones have hit on a solution with broad appeal, but there are a few areas that need refinement before I will say Yojimbo &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->flows like water.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s it for the Yojimbo review. Next up on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac PIM review series<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is an examination of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DevonThink Personal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Stay tuned.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "This is part two of a <a href=\"/compare-5-info-managers/\">seven part series</a> comparing Mac Personal Information Managers. Today, I'm going to look at <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/\" target=\"_blank\">Yojimbo</a> version 1.5.1.\n\nAs I sat down to begin this review, I pondered discussing the Yojimbo/samurai metaphor, when it struck me that the name of the company is perhaps more relevant. I had never considered why this company is called 'Bare Bones Software,' but maybe it has something to do with a focus on creating applications that hone in on the bare essentials.

Of course, it also works very well. Few applications meet this high standard.\n\nI think Yojimbo is on the right path, but it's not quite there yet.\n<h3>Mastering the Onslaught</h3>\nYojimbo is an information manager and note-taking application made by the people behind the acclaimed industrial text/code editor <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">BBEdit</a>. The tag line for Yojimbo is '<em>Master the Onslaught</em>.' I suppose the metaphor goes something like this: Yojimbo is a samurai at your disposal to slice through your information overload. And, as a samurai, it's going to slice with style and maximum economy. While the name and the tag are cool, does Yojimbo live up to the imagery it evokes? For the most part, yes.\n\nLooking at it from the viewpoint of the user interface, Yojimbo stands out from the competition. A person who knows nothing about this app can, as advertised, jump right in and start collecting data. The user controls are standardized Apple fare, so you know what to expect. In fact, there's not much to say about the user interface because there's not much to it. It has a distinct minimalist feel to it.

You may also customize the Yojimbo toolbar by adding/deleting your favorite items.\n\nIf there is any criticism to levy against the interface, it's that some users may pine for a few alternative layout options. Personally, I like the interface. It's one of the things that drew me to the program.\n\nHowever, the samurai metaphor doesn't hold up as well for me when it comes to organization, filtering and searching. It's quite good, but it's not great. I'll get to this in more depth soon, but first let's look at getting data in and out of the program.\n<h3>Capturing Data</h3>\nThe type of data you can enter in Yojimbo compares favorably with other apps in this class: you can stuff it full of text, MS Word documents, RTFs, PDFs, image files (except for RAW images, a reasonable exception), bookmarks, and web archives. You can't, however, import any other proprietary document formats other than Word files. While the range of document types Yojimbo accepts is about the same as other applications in this field, I think Pages documents should be supported. This is a Mac app, after all.\n\nI should add that you can also add emails, but they are only imported as bookmarks ‚Äî if you drag and drop them into the app you create a link back to the originating app (i.e. Mail). To get the actual email message text into Yojimbo, you can use this free <a href=\"http://www.hawkwings.net/2006/09/04/script-to-pipe-emails-into-yojimbo/\" target=\"_blank\">AppleScript</a> created by a Yojimbo developer (I use it in concert with <a href=\"http://www.indev.ca/MailActOn.html\" target=\"_blank\">MailActOn</a>).\n\nAppleScript support is a strong feature of Yojimbo, by the way. A quick web search turns up many user-generated scripts free for you to try. The only problem here is that they are a bit hard to find. I wish that Bare Bones would compile user-created scripts on their site.\nIn addition to dragging and dropping files into the app, you can directly type in new notes in rich or plain text. Unique among the PIM crowd, Yojimbo also provides two built-in templates to handle password and serial number data as well, which is a nice touch. One welcome addition would be a user-defined open template (or user-created templates). For example, I would like to create a car maintenance record template with field names that I define.\n\nThere are several other ways to add data besides direct input and the 'drag and drop.' Yojimbo also offers a 'drop dock' that integrates into any corner of your Mac screen. I put mine in the lower left-hand side of my screen and made it as transparent as possible so it doesn't stick out. The drop dock allows you to directly drag and drop to the main library or directly to a specific folder. I prefer this type of 'drop box' to those that in other apps that sit directly on the desktop because I can get at it without leaving the program I'm working in.\n\nThe only minor complaint I have about the drop dock is that you have to click <em>precisely</em> on the word 'Yojimbo' to minimize it. If you miss the target, it stays extended. If you are an Apple Dock user, you can also drag items to the Yojimbo dock icon. This will import the item to your library, but will not allow you to add an item to a specific folder.\n\nAnother way to add data is via a hotkey (F8 by default). This is my favorite feature. With Yojimbo running in the background, F8 will bring forth a quick-entry menu to import your clipboard. While this is handy, you need to know that it only handles text (a note, bookmark, password, serial number, or web archive). If you copy a file (a RTF, Doc, image file or PDF, for example), you can't import it with this function. If you try, what you'll get is an unlinked icon file representing the file type for the document. That's annoying. It is nice that you can directly convert a copied URL from your browser to create a web archive, though. According to the developer, Yojimbo will 'examine the clipboard, and guess what kind of item you wish to create, and will default to that editing panel.' If Yojimbo guesses incorrectly, you can select a different item type by using keyboard shortcuts. This feature works well for me. One thing I don't get, though, is why the drop-down menu includes 'image' as an item choice since this quick-entry method doesn't properly import images copied to the clipboard.\n\nYou can also enter data into Yojimbo with AppleScripts (like the previously-mentioned Mail script). And there are user-created scripts out there that let you add special bookmarks to your web browser for one-click bookmarking or web archiving to Yojimbo. Finally, you can use the Apple Services menu to import copied text or URL direct to Yojimbo. This is handy if Yojimbo is not currently running and you want to quickly add an item or link from a given open application.\n\nWith so many different options to get info into your database, Yojimbo truly makes data entry an effortless process.\n<h3>Organizing and Finding Data</h3>\nNow let's next look at how data is organized. Here's where I have a bit of trouble 'mastering my onslaught.'\nYojimbo offers several ways to organize your stuff. First, you may create folders and drag items to these folders. Yojimbo calls these 'Collections' for obvious reasons. The most important thing to point out about the Collection folder is that you may not nest other folders. For example, I can't create a Collection for 'food' and place individual folders for various food categories under this top-level folder. Many users have asked for this, but Bare Bones developers have <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/mac/blog/2006/01/effortless_and_reliable_rich_s.html\" target=\"_blank\">ruled this out from the start</a>. Why? Presumably because they have decided that the built-in search and tagging functions are the best way to organize.\n\nThe app includes ten options for 'smart' collections (you'll probably be familiar with this concept from the Finder or iTunes). Smart folders are basically saved searches. With Yojimbo, you can view flagged items, recent, unsorted, untagged, archives, bookmarks, images, notes, passwords, and serial numbers. The frustrating part is that these smart folders cannot be modified in any way, nor can you create your own smart folders based on criteria of your choosing. Why not?\n\nIn addition to the 'dumb' and smart collections, Yojimbo also serves up 'Tag Collections.' This is a smart folder that collects items based on tags you've assigned to items in your library. While it's nice that you can choose to collect more than one tag into a tag collection (for example, you can gather all of your items tagged 'food' and 'recipe'), there are several major shortcomings. First, you can only create a collection based on tags. You can't create a more complex collection (say, all items with 'food' tags AND all flagged AND all recent items). Next, you can only collect tags that meet ALL conditions. There is no option to choose 'ANY' as a selection condition. This means that I can collect all items tagged 'food' and 'recipes,' but I can't collect together items that have the single tags of 'food' or 'recipes.' What I would like to have is robust smart folder support, similar to what I get in the Finder or in iTunes. Yojimbo is really tying our hands by not giving us more control. The last problem is that the tag collection folders you create provide no clues about what tags are being collected. The only way to tell is to open up the tag collection for editing, or to choose an item in the collection and taking a look at the tags.\n\nOne final note: you can't drag and drop into a Smart or Tag Collection. This makes sense in that these 'folders' really aren't folders at all, but are collections of items that meet certain search parameters. But wouldn't it be wonderful if you could drag an item into a Tag Collection, with Yojimbo automatically appending the tag or tags for that collection to that item?\nYojimbo also offers two other ways to organize data: flagging and labeling. Flagging is a way to keep track of hot items that require follow-up, although you could assign any meaning to a flagged item. A flag can either be on or off. Chances are, you're already familiar with the flag from other Mac apps. Me? I don't use them very often. Color labeling is a common type of organizational method as well (most notably in Finder). Unlike Yojimbo's built-in Smart Collections, you get full control over labels. You may change the name of a label and you may choose the colors of your labels. While you can select multiple items and label them in batch, you cannot create a rule to label items based on tags. You also cannot add a color label to a folder. You can, however, search for items based on label names, which is nice (I can search for all 'work' labels, for instance). I'm not a big label fan (in Yojimbo or any other app), but I might use this feature more if I had the ability to create more complex custom Smart Collections (a very handy app called <a href=\"http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php\" target=\"_blank\">Hazel</a> is a great example of how useful this can be ‚Äî and it's using built-in Mac OS features!).\n\nNow back to tagging. Yojimbo emphasizes tagging as a primary organization method. Indeed, tagged collections can be handy. But it's not good enough. And here is my biggest problem with Yojimbo: I need better tag management options. What I would like to see added is an on-the-fly tag filtering similar to what I've seen in <a href=\"http://culturedcode.com/things/\" target=\"_blank\">Things</a> and <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/\" target=\"_blank\">OmniFocus</a>. If Bare Bones won't give users the nested folder, then they might consider providing a more interactive method to filter through tags.\n\nAnd speaking of tags, an inspector just for tags would be handy: a place to view them, batch change them, delete them. It would also be nice if Yojimbo would label orphaned tags in this list that are no longer being used. Note that it's currently not possible to change or delete a tag.\nThe ultimate test of how well your data is organized is put to the test when you try and find something. One easy way to do this is use Yojimbo's very speedy search engine. I have no complaints in this department. You can search by any word in an item, by tag and by label. Since Yojimbo is Spotlight-enabled, you can also search straight from Spotlight even when Yojimbo's not opened. I love having the ability to search for certain tagged items from my Yojimbo database using Spotlight. Very handy.\n\nAs for the search function <em>within</em> Yojimbo, it could be made better if we had that inspector pane with a list of all of our tags (what if I can't remember the tags I assigned?). The other way to find what you're looking for, of course, is via your Collections. I've already talked about why this doesn't meet my needs. If I had full control over my smart collections, Yojimbo would be a much better tool for organizing and finding things. I would personally also like the added ability to nest folders. I know, I know...hierarchical folders are so 20th century...but many people like to manage their data this way. Yojimbo went half-way by providing folders, so why are they against providing a nested folder option for those who want it? I don't get it. If the idea is that you shouldn't really need hierarchical folders, then the developers should get rid of them entirely. I'm all for that ‚Äî provided I get much better tagging, filtering and smart folder creat\nion capabilities.\n<h3>A Few Nuts and Bolts</h3>\nNow I need to add a few additional points about how Yojimbo physically handles your data. Consider how to get your data back out. It's very easy to do with Yojimbo: simply select what you want from your library and choose 'export'. However, it's important to note that the only metadata that will be preserved once you export your stuff are item creation dates. Your tags, labels, and flags will be lost. That's a shame.\nI'm quite unhappy with this. Say, for instance, I someday decide to move some of my Yojimbo data back to the Finder so I can manage these items with <a href=\"http://www.ironicsoftware.com/leap/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Leap</a> (a tag-centric program for managing all the files on your system). I would lose all my carefully crafted tags! Thanks to reader Brab for suggesting I check out metadata 'persistence,' by the way. I wouldn't have thought of this myself.\n\nI also need to comment briefly on how Yojimbo data is physically stored. While some PIMs store your stuff in what's called a flat file structure (in other words, directly in the Finder), Yojimbo stores everything in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite\" target=\"_blank\">SQLite</a> database tucked away in your user library. While I've never had any trouble with the database, I came across many comments on the web from people worried about corruption. If the database gets corrupted, all of your data is potentially hosed. That's a bit worrisome.\n\nBut there's nothing much to worry about if you regularly back up your system. You can back up your Yojimbo database with Time Machine, in case your wondering. I came across some posts on the web suggesting it doesn't work, but it did for me. I tested this by deleting my entire database from my <strong>user&gt;Library&gt;Application Support&gt;Yojimbo folder</strong>, then I replaced these files with a backed-up copy from Time Machine. It restored just fine.\n\nOne more thing to consider with Yojimbo is that it duplicates a file upon import. So if I drag a PDF into the application from my Documents folder, it will still be in my Documents folder. I'll just have an extra copy of it now stored in the Yojimbo database. I'm not crazy about this. I could delete the origninal files, but then I'm relying on one database to store all of my precious files. I could keep two copies (one in my Document folder, one in my Yojimbo database) but things would get confusing if you later changed something in one of those versions; they wouldn't be in sync. My solution: I choose to not import most of my documents into Yojimbo. I primarily use it as a digital junk drawer.\n\nFinally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that Yojimbo supports encryption for individual items. It works great, but I wonder why Yojimbo doesn't have a built-in Smart Collection to view all encrypted items. A work around for this is to create a tag called 'encrypt' for all your encrypted items, then create Tag Collection or search on that tag.\n<h3>The Verdict</h3>\nYojimbo is a PIM that occupies a specific place on the info management spectrum. That place for me is as a lightweight tool to quickly and easily capture snippets of info. Yojimbo provides a good home to all of those little bits and pieces that don't fit anywhere else on my Mac. It may not be the best solution for a complete desktop information management solution (by 'complete,' I mean an application that you are comfortable using as an archive and repository for ALL your critical data ‚Äî including long and complex documents that you frequently edit). If you need this type of functionality, you may want to consider another solution.\n\nI think Yojimbo excels at grabbing data of all varieties, but I'm less enthusiastic when it comes to finding what I'm looking for and filtering through my data collection. As my database grows, I find it increasingly hard to keep it organized and find what I want.\n\nStill, there are many things that I really like. What I appreciate most about Yojimbo is how easy and quick it is to add new data. I'm also quite fond of the minimalist user interface.\n\n<em>1. Could I figure out how to use the application with minimal fuss (without documentation)?</em>\nThe developer states that there is 'no learning curve.' I found this to be largely true, but there are a few features you may not discover if you don't read the instructions. When you first launch Yojimbo, by the way, Bare Bones includes a helpful note that summarizes all the big ideas about how to use the app.\n\n<em>2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?</em>\nYes, but I'm growing less enthusiastic as my database grows larger. I'm particularly frustrated that I can't create more complex smart folders. I also would like to see more robust tagging support.\n\n<em>3. How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?</em>\nVery well. In addition to the variety of data entry methods I detailed in this review, Yojimbo supports .Mac syncing for other Yojimbo installations on your network (and you can use your one license to install Yojimbo on multiple Macs in your household!). Yojimbo data is also spotlight indexed. This means you can search from spotlight on a tag name, and all of your Yojimbo items that match that tag will pop up (Yojimbo does not need to be running to use this). Super. By the way, if you want to access your Yojimbo database remotely (from a web browser or on your iPhone), a company called Flying Mac sells a slick Web 2.0 app called <a href=\"http://flyingmac.com/webjimbo/\" target=\"_blank\">Webjimbo</a> to meet this need. The downside? It will cost you an additional $30.\n\n<em>4. How did the program 'feel?' How 'Mac-like' is it?</em>\nThis application has a great feel to it. The controls are intuitive. It's sleek. And if you want to know how Mac-like it is, consider this <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/business/macmarket/yojimbo.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apple article</a>.\n\nYojimbo is not perfect, but it's a reliable, speedy and handy tool in my toolbox. I think Bare Bones have hit on a solution with broad appeal, but there are a few areas that need refinement before I will say Yojimbo '<em>flows like water.</em>'\n\nThat's it for the Yojimbo review. Next up on the <a href=\"/compare-5-info-managers/\">Mac PIM review series</a> is an examination of <a href=\"http://www.devon-technologies.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DevonThink Personal</a>. Stay tuned.\n<blockquote>NOTE: (March, 2009) I'm still planning to complete the rest of the reviews in this series. Really.

I settled on these five because they represent the best of the best of what&rsquo;s available for the Mac. All of these applications share a similar feature-set: the ability to store, organize, and retrieve personal information from text notes, to images, to PDFs, to web pages all from one place.

I now have a much better platform from which to dive into my reviews. I also spent several hours reading through reviews from other blogs, as well as reading through material on developer&rsquo;s sites.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth pointing out, though, that I did this retrospectively. In other words, I chose these five programs for personal reasons: I currently use Yojimbo for short notes, snippets and serial numbers. I use DEVONthink to store all of my writing clips and ideas (fiction, primarily). And I like to use VoodooPad as a learning/flash card tool (right now, I&rsquo;m using it to store notes as I learn javascript). What initially led me to these three applications is what is often called &lsquo;buzz.&rsquo; As someone who follows Mac software rather closely, I heard (and read) repeated positive comments, so I gave them a try. Simple as that. Am I happy with them? Not entirely, but they&rsquo;re pretty good. How&rsquo;s that for an answer? I promise to offer a bit more detail for the reviews!</p>\n<p>For the other two apps ‚Äî Together and EagleFiler ‚Äî I&rsquo;ve not yet used them. However, they were recommended by readers who know a heck of a lot about Mac software (and organization), so I added them to the list. From what I&rsquo;ve read so far, they appear to be rising rapidly in popularity among people I consider power users. I will use review these two programs last to take advantage of the full evaluation period (Together offers a 15 day trial; EagleFiler offers 30 days).</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m going into this series with an open mind. I&rsquo;m perfectly willing to abandon my current multi-app workflow if I find another app (or apps) that better serve my needs. This last statement &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->serves my needs better<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; is an important distinction to make: my needs are not your needs, so I&rsquo;m not going to claim that my conclusions will apply to all users. What I think will come out of this is a fairly good synopsis of each app which I hope will serve as a launching point for readers who are trying to figure out where to begin.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll be evaluating these applications with an emphasis on the same set of questions I&rsquo;ve used for other reviews on this site:</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.

I debated wether or not to add this level of detail because, frankly, one could argue that it doesn't really mean much. Still, it was a useful exercise. It allowed me to get a rough idea of the current popularity of these apps. Anecdotally, I suspected that Yojimbo was one of the more popular PIMs at this time, and this unscientific 'sample' at least bore out that many people apparently use it. I also compared users and downloads between these four apps with some of the other popular PIM apps for the Mac and concluded that my selection was a good representation of the field.\n\nImportantly, this exercise also forced me to do a lot of searching and a lot of reading: I didn't just count download and users, I read all the comments on each of the three sites (iusethis, versiontracker, macupdate). I now have a much better platform from which to dive into my reviews. I also spent several hours reading through reviews from other blogs, as well as reading through material on developer's sites.\n\nIt's worth pointing out, though, that I did this retrospectively. In other words, I chose these five programs for personal reasons: I currently use Yojimbo for short notes, snippets and serial numbers. I use DEVONthink to store all of my writing clips and ideas (fiction, primarily). And I like to use VoodooPad as a learning/flash card tool (right now, I'm using it to store notes as I learn javascript). What initially led me to these three applications is what is often called 'buzz.' As someone who follows Mac software rather closely, I heard (and read) repeated positive comments, so I gave them a try. Simple as that. Am I happy with them? Not entirely, but they're pretty good. How's that for an answer? I promise to offer a bit more detail for the reviews!\n\nFor the other two apps ‚Äî Together and EagleFiler ‚Äî I've not yet used them. However, they were recommended by readers who know a heck of a lot about Mac software (and organization), so I added them to the list. From what I've read so far, they appear to be rising rapidly in popularity among people I consider power users. I will use review these two programs last to take advantage of the full evaluation period (Together offers a 15 day trial; EagleFiler offers 30 days).\n\nI'm going into this series with an open mind. I'm perfectly willing to abandon my current multi-app workflow if I find another app (or apps) that better serve my needs. This last statement '<em>serves my needs better</em>' is an important distinction to make: my needs are not your needs, so I'm not going to claim that my conclusions will apply to all users. What I think will come out of this is a fairly good synopsis of each app which I hope will serve as a launching point for readers who are trying to figure out where to begin.\n\nI'll be evaluating these applications with an emphasis on the same set of questions I've used for other reviews on this site:\n\n<em>1. Could I figure out how to use the application with minimal fuss (without documentation)?</em>\n<em>2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?</em>\n<em>3. How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?</em>\n<em>4. How did the program 'feel?' How 'Mac-like' is it?</em>\n\nOf course, I'll also be looking at questions specific to info managers: <em>how well could I organize all of my stuff? How easy is it to get data in/out? How is the information stored? What organization tools are available? How scalable is it? How easy is it to find what I'm looking for?</em>\n\nI hope to get these reviews out in fairly rapid succession, but I have to warn you that it'll take some time. I'm going to evaluate the applications I'm most familiar with first.\n\nStayed tuned for a review of Yojimbo.\n",

The first service is a free package for simple forum hosting. It purportedly makes setting up a forum as easy as setting up a WordPress.com site.

The second is a set of WordPress plugins (for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress MultiUser<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) which offers a very simple and easy way to transform any blog into a social network platform √† la MySpace.

He's going to be sending in some items of interest to share from the convention this week. Here's what he had to say about Day One:</em>\n\n\"The National Association of Broadcasters annual convention is a massive event filling all four halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center. Having spent an entire day thoroughly exploring just one of the halls, I‚Äôd like to share a few items that caught my eye:\n<h3>1. Logic Keyboard Refresh</h3>\nFirst off are new keyboards offerings from <a href=\"http://www.logickeyboard.com\" target=\"_blank\">Logic Keyboard</a>. Switching from the old G5-style Apple keyboards to the newly redesigned Apple USB slim style, Logic Keyboard provides input devices with shortcut markings for many major creative applications such as Photoshop, Final Cut, Aperture and Avid. If your are frequent user of any of these programs but haven‚Äôt yet memorized the shortcuts, these keyboards are an excellent visual aid. The new style keyboards will be shipping in about a month and will maintain the previous model‚Äôs $50 price markup over the standard Apple keyboard.\n<h3>2. Flip4Mac News</h3>\nNext, I‚Äôd like to share a little information I received from a <a href=\"http://www.telestream.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Telestream</a> rep regarding <a href=\"http://www.flip4mac.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Flip4Mac</a>. Since upgrading to Leopard, I've been experiencing serious problems with WMV playback. When trying to play any WMV file larger than 7-8MB, I get a status bar, the ‚Äúspinning beach ball of doom‚Äù and a very, very, long wait. I‚Äôve posted over various forums looking for help with this issue but it appeared I was the only one experiencing it. Thanks to the very helpful Telestream reps, I learned today that mine is not an isolated occurrence and they have received reports from many other users with same or similar issues. According to them, it is a (currently) unresolved conflict between Flip4Mac and any version of QuickTime more recent than 7.4.1. So how do you fix it? At this point the only options are to roll back QuickTime to 7.4.1 or live with it in the hopes that the next QuickTime update does the job. An ideal solution this isn‚Äôt, as many of the changes in the recent QuickTime updates are critical security fixes. I should point out that, as a long time user of Telestream‚Äôs professional products, I have found the company to be very quick at resolving issues I've had. Initial problems that arose after the release of Leopard resulted in an update within two or three short days. I‚Äôm confident that if a fix is not available in a reasonable time that the issue is beyond their control. My next conversation about it will be with Apple.\n<h3>3. New offerings from LaCie</h3>\nLast note of interest for today is a preview of new portable hard drive offerings from <a href=\"http://www.lacie.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LaCie</a>. Large capacity, small form and bus-powered! Everything a road warrior media producer could ask for! A new model of the Little Big Disk Quadra gives you 500GB from two drives in a RAID 0 configuration for read/write speed with eSATA, FireWire 400, FireWire 800 and USB 2.0 connections to get all that data to and from your computer. If you‚Äôre running FireWire, you will won't even need the included power brick ‚Äî so you end up with a package that would fit in my overly style-conscious girlfriend‚Äôs Italian purse, with room for all the mysterious things she carries in there! Of course, if you‚Äôre afraid she might hit you with said purse, as I often am, you may choose to go with the new Rugged Hard Disk with rubber bumper that surrounds a metal enclosure containing a shock absorber-mounted 320GB drive! In any case, now you can worry more about your head than your hard drive.\n\nHopefully day two will bring plenty more interesting and exciting things for me to drool over. If so, and provided I don‚Äôt electrocute myself with my slobber, I‚Äôll be back tomorrow with some more fun ideas for spending your tax refund from NAB 2008!\"\n",

				"content_text": "Here are a few items that caught my interest this week:\n<h3>1. MacHeist Bundle</h3>\nThey're back. <a href=\"http://www.macheist.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MacHeist</a> announced a $49 bundle today (a variety of 12 apps offered during the past two Heists). If you bought the previous bundles, this isn't for you. If you didn't, you might find something here to pique your interest. The apps that stick out from the pack for me are <a href=\"http://www.midnightapps.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cha-Ching</a> and <a href=\"http://www.devon-technologies.com/products/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">DevonThink Personal</a>. To my surprise, I've grown quite fond of <a href=\"http://coversutra.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CoverSutra</a>, too.\n<h3>2. Apple news aggregator debuts</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.appleenthusiast.com/page-one.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Enthusiast</a> is a new, unimaginatively named Mac site launched this week. It strives to be your one-stop-shop for all things Mac, the page refreshing every 15 minutes to keep you up to date with the latest. Me? I don't care for it. It's too busy. Too crowded. It reminds me of CNN's Situation Room, which I can't stand. There is such a thing as too much when it comes to presenting information. I prefer to subscribe to feeds of individual sites of my choosing using the free and excellent <a href=\"http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/Default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">NetNewsWire</a>. Speaking of feeds, you can't subscribe to an Apple Enthusiast RSS feed (which makes sense given that RSS is how they are aggregating all of these links).\n<h3>3. Keep your day job</h3>\nThe last episode of <a href=\"http://macbreaktech.com/63/making-mac-your-business/#more-63\" target=\"_blank\">MacBreak Tech</a> was very interesting. The topic was making your Mac your business. Lots of great tips, including the best advice of all: \"Don't quit your day job.\"\n<h3>4. One phone number to rule them all</h3>\n&nbsp;\n\nAlso featured on the above-mentioned podcast were a couple of powerful phone services. One you've probably heard of (<a href=\"http://www.grandcentral.com/home\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Central</a> from Google), one you've probably not (<a href=\"http://www.k7.net/\" target=\"_blank\">k7.net</a>). Grand Central is currently an invite-only Beta (anyone?), but you can now sign up with your preferred area code and see what happens. The <a href=\"http://www.grandcentral.com/home/features\" target=\"_blank\">features</a> of this service are amazing ‚Äî one more example of how Google is taking over the world. The other service, k7.net, offers to send your faxes and voicemail straight to your email inbox for free. The only downside is that you can only choose from a Seattle area code.\n<h3>5. SpaceTime</h3>\nHere's a new application that I couldn't resist trying out. <a href=\"http://www.spacetime.com/download.php\" target=\"_blank\">SpaceTime</a> is a Windows-only 3D web search browser (currently in beta). The Mac version is in the works. I fired it up via <a href=\"http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/\" target=\"_blank\">VMWare Fusion</a> and...I was underwhelmed. It's an interesting idea, but I just don't see myself using such a tool. At least not in it's current form. It did raise an interesting question, though. What's in store for the Mac in terms of the 3D user interface? I haven't seen any app hit the streets yet using the full-blown, Leopard-powered 3D capabilities embodied in Time Machine. I think user interfaces that embrace 3D will walk a fine line between utility and eye candy. One could make the argument that Time Machine is a bit heavy on the eye candy, after all. But I kinda like it; I think the Time Machine metaphor is uniquely suited for 3D presentation. Still, I wouldn't mind an alternative 2D Time Machine interface option, similar to what we have for the 2D or 3D Dock (just because I'm always for customization options). But I digress. All I really can say at this point is that I'm eager to see how Mac developers integrate 3D ideas into future UIs ‚Äî I'll bet the most successful ventures will use it sparingly.\n<h3>6. Get IRCed</h3>\nInternet Relay Chat is still going strong. I haven't used IRC for a long, long time, but I recently came across an app that spurred me to once again tap into the conversation. It's a top-notch free client called <a href=\"http://colloquy.info/\" target=\"_blank\">Colloquy</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>7. Cocoa links</h3>\nHere's a small 'aggregator' of sorts that I really do like. It's <a href=\"http://cocoadevcentral.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cocoa Dev Central</a>, a collection of links that are quite handy if you're interested in learning how to program for the Mac and don't know where to begin. Make sure you check out <a href=\"http://www.cocoalab.com/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">Cocoa Lab's free online book</a>.\n",

I would have posted this sooner if not for the recent releases of WordPress 2.5 and RapidWeaver 3.6.6. I've now spent a few days with these new versions, so I'll recap what's new and provide my impressions here. <br /><br />As I've worked on this comparison, it's become even more apparent how different the two tools are: in terms of user base, RW is a flea to the WP gorilla. In terms of the platform, RW is a Mac-only application that is tied to the desktop, while WP is a free roaming, web-based platform comfortable on a variety of operating systems. And in terms of usage, RW attempts to be an all-inclusive website creation tool while WP specializes in blogging and dynamic content management. Still, I maintain that this is a handy comparison, mainly because RW is more than capable as a blogging platform &mdash; and it seems to be gaining in popularity for Mac users. And for bloggers and those who want to blog, WordPress is known to be a widely popular and flexible choice. So I hope to place both tools in context to help you make a better-informed decision. To get the most out of this, I recommend you start by reviewing the other <a href=\"/rapidweaver-vs-wordpress/\">entries</a> in this series. <br /><br />Now let's wrap it up:</p>\n<fieldset><br />\n<h4>1. RapidWeaver | <a href=\"http://www.realmac.com/\">Developer's site</a> | <a href=\"/2008/03/12/rapidweaver-vs-wordpress-ii-rapidweaver-review/\">full review</a></h4>\n<br /><a href=\"/2008/03/12/rapidweaver-vs-wordpress-ii-rapidweaver-review/\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/rw-icon.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"RapidWeaver Inbox\" /></a><br />\n<h3>Recap:</h3>\nRapidWeaver targets people with little to no web design experience seeking a simple way to produce a professional-looking, standards-compliant, and highly customizable mixed-content website. It&rsquo;s a stand-alone, client-side web design tool. As a content management tool, the built-in capabilities of this app are easy to use; and the user interface is much friendlier than most other web-based content management systems. It&rsquo;s also easy to set up and maintain. It&rsquo;s used by experienced developers, too, because it&rsquo;s a handy way to quickly build and deploy a site with minimal fuss, and it&rsquo;s fairly easy to create custom templates.<br /><br />\n<h3>Pro:</h3>\ngreat themes from RW and third-party developers; customization options are outstanding for most themes; dedicated user base; great forums and customer support; outstanding third-party add-ons; easy to modify a site for beginners; frequent updates and improvements; Snippets library makes it easy to drag and drop bits of often-used code<br /><br />\n<h3>Con:</h3>\nNot free like WordPress; blog commenting is handled by HaloScan, so it's not well-integrated with the app; many third-party plugins are relatively expensive; some paid plugins seem like they should be core features; occasional quirky and/or buggy behavior; loading up a large site is slow; publishing a large site is still a bit slow and occasionally doesn't work (see next paragraph); some of the site customization/configurability options are not very obvious or well-explained; not easy to mix and match dynamic/static content on a page; doesn't integrate with <a href=\"http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/\" target=\"_blank\">MarsEdit</a> for blogging<br /><br />\n<h3>Latest Update:</h3>\nRapidWeaver 3.6.6 is now out. While this is a relatively modest update, the developers claim that upload speed is now significantly enhanced. I tested this claim out on my wife's site by inserting some custom javascript for her blog page and then publishing the changes with the previous version of RW (this forced an update on 140 files for her site). I then deleted the change, updated the site again, then applied the update. Finally, I reapplied the javascript update and published changes again to see if it was substantially faster. In this case, publishing speeds were marginally, but not significantly, faster. On 3.6.6, I had to publish changes twice because one of her pages failed to upload. Once this happens, RW times out and simply stops updating. The only way to get out of the publishing mode is to Force Quit. So I've concluded that progress is being made, but I'm still seeing a bit of bugginess with my wife's large site. My wife still maintains that she must quit all open applications on the Mac prior to publishing her RW site in order to minimize the odds of a publishing error. Perhaps we have a third-party conflict. It's hard to say. All I've concluded is that most times the site publishes without a problem, but sometimes it fails. Final word: Realmac quickly released 3.6.7 to address a Tiger-specific problem days after 3.6.6 hit the streets. The developers recommend that Leopard users also update to this latest iteration. The catch is that Leopard users are not notified of the update through RW's software update feature. You can get it <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/download/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br /><br />\n<h3>The Verdict</h3>\n<br /><strong>1. Could I figure out how to use the application with minimal fuss (preferably without referring to documentation)?</strong><br /><br />Like chess, RapidWeaver is easy to learn but hard to master. It takes some time and dedication to learn how to customize sitewide preferences, page-specific preferences, sidebar content options and meta options. This is mainly because it takes a while to get used to the wide array of pop-up menus that contain all the customization and optimization tools. While it's easy to get a site up quickly, most users will need to dig into the manual and online forums to take advantage of all that RW offers.<br /><br /><strong>2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?</strong><br /><br />Oh yeah. I really enjoy using it. It may be daunting for newcomers to grasp how some aspects of the program work, but it's still much simpler than most other tools out there relative to the sheer amount of user-control possibilities.<br /><br /><strong>3. How easy is it to modify?</strong><br /><br />It's among the best. The coolest part is how a user with no CSS experience can robustly adjust site appearance (to include drop-dead easy manipulation of sidebar location, as well as page width for many themes). The developers have clearly put a tremendous amount of effort into creating a user interface that makes it possible for novices to customize a site beyond what most other website creation tools offer; added to this, the developers freely share developer kits to give more experienced users complete control over their sites, or to develop commercial plugins and themes.<br /><br /><strong>4. How easy is to set up a website and publish content?</strong><br /><br />Quite easy, but you will need to have a web host and know how to set up an FTP account (you can also publish to .Mac). <br /><br /><strong>5. How well does it handle lots and lots of pages and blog entries (scalability)?</strong><br /><br />I've previously noted that I have some concerns about this. According to the developers, this issue is a top priority for future releases. I'm confident they'll work it out.<br /><br /><strong>6. How did the program 'feel?' How 'Mac-like' is it?</strong><br /><br />This is where RapidWeaver really stands out. I think the developers do a great job at striking a balance between simplicity and power to meet the need of most users. The design is clean. Mac users will find most controls are familiar since the tool is built with Mac OS X's native language. That also means that it integrates tightly with the Mac OS. I say it's as slick as Apple's <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ilife/iweb/\" target=\"_blank\">iWeb</a>, just twice as powerful.<br /><br /><strong>7. How many plugins, add ons, etc. are available (expandability)?</strong><br /><br />Better by the day. Check out the <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/addons/\" target=\"_blank\">Add-Ons</a> on the developer's site for a taste of what's available. <br /><br />Overall, I think RapidWeaver is a wonderful tool. It focuses on simplicity, minimalism, and style &mdash; but it packs a lot of choices, features, and customization options within. While there is certainly room for improvement, RW is rapidly evolving: since version 3.6 launched at the end of last May, <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/feeds/rapidweaverupdates.html\">seven</a> significant updates have already been released. And <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/blog/files/tag-4.0.php\">version 4.0</a> is just around the corner. If you want to get a great-looking site up fast and want a simple way to maintain it, this is probably the best tool out there for the Mac.<br /></fieldset>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<fieldset><br />\n<h4>1. WordPress | <a href=\"http://www.wordpress.org/\">Developer's site</a> | <a href=\"/2008/03/29/rapidweaver-vs-wordpress-iii-wordpress-review/\">full review</a></h4>\n<br /><a href=\"/2008/03/29/rapidweaver-vs-wordpress-iii-wordpress-review/\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/wp-icon2.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"WordPress\" /></a><br /><br />\n<h3>Recap:</h3>\nI reviewed the WordPress.org open source package (not to be confused with the <a href=\"http://wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com</a> installation), which is a free blog publishing system for Mac, PC, or Linux. It is first and foremost a tool for the weblog, designed to support things that bloggers need most. If you don&rsquo;t want to pay any money upfront, flexibility and customization options are important to you, and you have some (or great) knowledge of CSS and HTML, it&rsquo;s a solid choice. If you don&rsquo;t know anything about web design, you will still get a lot out of it because the basic administration tools are robust and there are tons of plugins and themes available to make your site unique. Also note that there is a <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPressMU\" target=\"_blank\">multi-user WordPress</a> option if you want multiple blogs from one installation.<br /><br />\n<h3>Pro</h3>\nfree; easy to set up; tons of free templates; plugins abound; edit your site from anywhere, or mail in updates; great integration with MarsEdit; fairly easy to upgrade; newly redesigned Dashboard much cleaner and easier to use; one-click updating now available for most plugins; great online documentation<br /><br />\n<h3>Con</h3>\ntheme modification difficult for those with no web design experience; limited support if you use WP.org installation; the multitude of site settings may be daunting for some users; web interface is great, but no match for simplicity of RapidWeaver<br /><br />\n<h3>Latest Update:</h3>\nA major new version of WP was released hours after I posted my <a href=\"/2008/03/29/rapidweaver-vs-wordpress-iii-wordpress-review/\">review</a>. I posted a <a href=\"/2008/03/29/wordpress-25-released/\">summary</a> of the big changes and have spent the past week getting used to the new features. The big news with WordPress 2.5 is certainly the Dashboard (admin Panel): it's completely different. I have to say I think it's much better than the old design. The starting page of the Dashboard is now much more useful and is now user-customizable. Another nice feature is that you no longer need to update plugins manually, which saves time and effort. I also like the new built-in function that enables easier gallery creation. And if you upload images with EXIF data, WP now reads this metadata automatically so you can integrate it into your template. Check out this <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/\" target=\"_blank\">WP blog entry</a> for a full list of new features and a great screencast.<br /><br />\n<h3>The Verdict</h3>\n<br /><strong>1. Could I figure out how to use the application with minimal fuss (preferably without referring to documentation)?</strong><br /><br />I initially had to refer to online documentation to set up my site and to learn how to upgrade it, but it's not too hard. If you need help with the installation, many web hosts now offer automatic installs. With the release of 2.5, the Dashboard (Admin Panel) is now much easier to grasp, mainly because all of the plugin management and back end settings have been moved out of the main Admin area to, appropriately, a separate 'settings' section. I think most users will find the basic admin tools are very easy to use. Fine tuning a site's settings takes a little more patience and time to get right. <br /><br /><strong>2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?</strong><br /><br />Certainly. I'm still using WP for this site. I have long thought I'd like to switch to different platform called <a href=\"http://modxcms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ModX</a>, but I'm reconsidering this now. One reason is that I have a lot of time and energy invested in my WP site and it would be a major inconviencence and time-sucker to make the switch. Second reason is I'm not sure how I'd migrate over the posts and comments to this new platform. Last reason is that the new version of WP offers a lot of nice new features. Like RW, WordPress releases updates quite frequently, so I'm optimistic that this is a platform that will continue to get better and better over time.<br /><br /><strong>3. How easy is it to modify?</strong><br /><br />This is perhaps the weak link in WordPress. While content management is easy, WP themes are not as easily customized as they are in RapidWeaver. To be fair, some themes do offer some easier-to-use style editing options (e.g. Kubrick offers a fairly easy way to modify header image, fonts and color), but choices are limited.  In order to access all theme customization settings, the Dashboard Theme Editor presents your theme's style sheet and PHP page code within a text window; the problem is that most novice users probably won't be comfortable modifying this code. Still, I'd bet that most users are probably quite happy with picking a theme and sticking with it, and those who want to create a custom site will likely know what to do. What's nice about the built-in view of your site pages is that you can remotely make changes if you're away from your Mac. I personally never use the built-in WP theme editor functions. I maintain and adjust my theme on my Mac using <a href=\"http://macrabbit.com/cssedit/\" target=\"_blank\">CSSEdit</a> and <a href=\"http://macromates.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TextMate</a>. For novice users who take the time to learn a little bit about <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/Css/default.asp\" target=\"_blank\">CSS</a>, simple color and font changes can be made relatively easily within the WP Dashboard. <br /><br /><strong>4. How easy is to set up a website and publish content?</strong><br /><br />It's quite easy if you're using the web-based Dashboard editor (version 2.5 now offers a greatly improved <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG\" target=\"_blank\">WYSIWYG</a> editor that works better and is expandable so you don't have to work within such a tiny window. It's even easier if you use MarsEdit. The nice thing about WP, of course, is that it's a pretty simple to use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\" target=\"_blank\">Content Management System</a> &mdash; all of your core content is easy to get at and relatively easy to modify via the Dashboard's <em>Write</em>, <em>Manage</em>, <em>Design</em>, and <em>Comments</em> tabs. I can't speak for uploading images, video, etc. via the Dashboard. I upload all external files using <a href=\"http://www.panic.com/transmit/\" target=\"_blank\">Transmit</a>, an FTP client. I should note that version 2.5 now offers multi-file upload with progress bar indicators, so it sounds like it's now easier than it's ever been to upload files via the Dashboard.<br /><br /><strong>5. How well does it handle lots and lots of pages and blog entries (scalability)?</strong><br /><br />I've never heard any complaints in this department. My site, while not huge, is still fairly large. I've never had any issues or problems that I've associated with the size and complexity of my site. <br /><br /><strong>6. How did the program 'feel?' How 'Mac-like' is it?</strong><br /><br />If I were managing my site design and content solely via the WP Dashboard, I don't think I'd be as happy with WordPress as a blogging platform. However, adding in some additional tools, as I noted in the main review, makes WP fly. It's no small thing that some of my favorite Mac apps (CSSEdit, TextMate, MarsEdit, Transmit) work seamlessly with WordPress, so this makes managing my site a real pleasure. As for the Dashboard, it's better than ever with version 2.5. And it's better than most web-based CMS panels. But in comparison to the third-party apps I use to manage this site, the Dashboard just doesn't compare. All I really use the Dashboard for, in fact, is to manage my plugins and check my WP stats. Regardless, the best thing about it is that I can access all of my site anywhere, anytime. That's something I can't do with RapidWeaver.<br /><br /><strong>7. How many plugins, add ons, etc. are available (expandability)?</strong><br /><br />Enough to make your head spin. If you want a feature in your sidebar, chances are a widget already exists to meet your needs. The built-in <em>Text</em> widget also allows one to cut and paste HTML, text, and javascript on the fly to create new widget functionality. It couldn't be easier. There are a mind-numbing array of <a href=\"http://themes.wordpress.net/\" target=\"_blank\">themes</a> freely available. As for plugins (beyond the Widget), there are tons of options to choose from. Plugin variety and ease of use are the killer feature of WordPress.<br /><br />In summary, WordPress is hard to beat for blogging. It's powerful, adaptable and simple enough to use. One of the best parts about it is that the user base and plugin/theme developer base are huge, which means that an answer to a question you may have or an extended feature that you may want are only a quick web search away.<br /><br /></fieldset>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p><br /><br />I started this series because I noticed that a lot of people were reaching the site upon searching for a comparison of these two applications. What's apparent to me after taking a closer look is this: if you want the easiest possible solution and you don't mind paying $49, RapidWeaver is the way to go. If you want open-ended flexibility and care primarily about blogging, you may prefer WordPress.<br /><br />And now, a message from our sponsor. Just joking. There are no sponsors. I'm looking at these two web publishing tools solely because I want to and I've used both of them quite extensively. I have no ties to the developers. Of course, there are many other website creation tools, blogging tools and CMS platforms out there. My recommendation: try out two or three before making up your mind. I've said this before, but it's worth repeating: you can easily test out a variety of web-based platforms locally on your Mac using the freely-available <a href=\"http://www.mamp.info/en/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">MAMP</a>. And, of course, RapidWeaver offers a timed trial (as do almost all Mac third party apps) which will give you plenty of time to make up your mind.<br /><br />If you were expecting a clear winner between these two publishing platforms, you may be disappointed by my conclusion that WordPress and RapidWeaver are both great choices. <br /><br />In fact, you might consider using both tools: WordPress for your blog and RapidWeaver for everything else. This great suggestion came from reader <a href=\"/2008/03/12/rapidweaver-vs-wordpress-ii-rapidweaver-review/#gotocomment\">Brab</a>, who runs <a href=\"http://www.movabletype.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Moveable Type</a> in tandem with a RapidWeaver for his <a href=\"http://alan.petitepomme.net/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">site</a>. It's a good way to go if you're looking for total blog control but also want the style, ease and flexibility of RapidWeaver. The idea of combining the best of both tools is very appealing. My biggest concern is how well I could integrate the two, but I came across a <a href=\"http://nilrogsplace.se/tutorials/wordpress/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">tutorial</a> which indicates it's entirely possible to make WP and RW coexist seamlessly. I might have to try this out. <br /><br />So, that's about it for the <a href=\"/rapidweaver-vs-wordpress/\">RapidWeaver Vs. WordPress series</a>. Hope you get something out of it.</p>\n",

I have to say it sounded better without it.\n\nIf you are a serious audiophile, an audio professional, and/or more knowledgeable about audio settings than me, you may love this. Reading through the OSS 3D forums, it appears that there are (were) many passionate OSS 3D users who swear by this digital enhancement package, and <strong>Hear</strong> appears to be the new face of OSS 3D.\n\nIt would be unfair of me to say this isn't a good product after such a short trial. More likely, it's user ignorance. Still, what I look for in a good Mac app is usability right from the install. I didn't get that sense here. I also didn't get adequate user documentation. But I'll end on a positive note: it did sound good when I ran it straight through my iMac speakers. It produced a solid subwoofer sound and made my built-in speakers sound better (wider, deeper, more robust). It also produced some noticeable and nice 3D enhancement with the video I tested out.\n\nIf sound is important to you, why not give <strong>Hear</strong> a try. They offer a 30-day trial. You may have a better experience than I.\n\nI'll close by noting that I currently use <a href=\"http://www.srs-store.com/store-plugins/mall/iwow-plugin.asp\" target=\"_blank\">SRS iWow</a> ($19.99), a plug-in for iTunes. It improves the sound of iTunes music quite significantly ‚Äî especially for laptop speakers. It also simulates 360 degree sound for headphones. I use it with my iMac and it makes a noticeable difference. I like it. Mostly because it's very easy to use and the results sound quite good to my ears (I immediately know when it's not turned on when listening to my music). The one thing it doesn't do, though, is work outside of iTunes. That's a big shortcoming. I'd like to see this tool integrated into all of my Mac's audio output.\n\nUntil that day, it appears that Hear is the main game in town for system-wide audio enhancement. If anyone knows of any other similar app, please let me know.\n",

This is significant if you use image replacement for the widget title ‚Äî you'll have to update your CSS to reflect the new name.\n\nI also noticed that the new <em>wp-config.php</em> is different from previous versions, so be sure to use this updated file (this file hasn't changed in a long while, so I'm guessing that many people are in the habit of keeping their existing config file during upgrades).\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to copy over your old MySQL settings (user name, password, database name) into the new file (which is called 'wp-config-sample.php'), delete the old config file, then delete the word 'sample' from the <em>wp-config-sample.php</em> file.\n\nThe difference in this file is the addition of a secure key field. Enter a long, complicated key in this field as indicated (no need to remember it). This is part of a new <a href=\"http://www.cse.msu.edu/~alexliu/publications/Cookie/cookie.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">secure cookie encryption protocol</a>.\n\nI'll add my thoughts on this new version when I post the RapidWeaver Vs. WordPress final wrap-up.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>This is the third in a¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted -->four part series<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†comparing WordPress with RapidWeaver (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->and speaking of RapidWeaver, don&rsquo;t miss the¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted -->comment<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†from a lead RW developer on¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted -->that review<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a blog publishing system for Mac, PC, or Linux. I&rsquo;m assuming that most people who read this probably have heard of WordPress and have perhaps noted that many blogs use it. In terms of blogging platforms, WP ranks second in use only to Google&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blogger<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. That equates to millions of users. What accounts for this popularity? In short, it works. And it&rsquo;s free. Not only can you get a blog up and running quickly with WordPress, you can manage your blog with one of the best browser-based administration panels out there.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re considering WordPress, you need to understand the difference between <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress.org<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option is the WordPress answer to Blogger. It&rsquo;s a commercial web hosting venture which employs a version of WP that allows for multiple blogs within one installation. Once you sign up, you get hosting space, automatic installation, and a fixed number of themes, plugins, and widgets to customize your site. In general, you won&rsquo;t be able to modify much and you can&rsquo;t put ads on it. However, you will be able to modify <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than you would with Blogger. You&rsquo;ll be able to choose from a palette of widgets, move them around on your sidebar, choose a header photo (this option is only available with some themes), and activate some plugins, but you won&rsquo;t be able to style your page or modify the theme layout/design with the free package. Nor will you be able to choose from the wider universe of WP plugins and widgets available around the web.</p>\n<p>The basic package is free, but there are paid upgrades if you want to customize the styles of your chosen theme, get more storage space, or change your domain name to something other than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->your_blog.wordpress.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Most users choose the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WP.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option because it&rsquo;s easier to use, it&rsquo;s just as free as the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.org<!-- raw HTML omitted --> version, it offers better technical support, and it includes site hosting.</p>\n<p>Last point: since you will be using tried and tested themes, plugins and widgets with this option, you will be ensured of a standards-compliant site.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.org<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option offers an open source package of core files to run a WP blog. It is free to use and abuse however you&rsquo;d like within the terms of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->General Public License<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you choose this option, you will get a download of the files needed to make WordPress run, but you won&rsquo;t get a place to host it, you&rsquo;ll have to install it yourself and you won&rsquo;t get dedicated support. You will, however, have access to a veritable sea of plugins, widgets, and themes ‚Äî and you&rsquo;ll be able to fully customize and tweak your site. In other words, you have a level of freedom unmatched by what you&rsquo;d get from a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WP.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hosted blog. If you want the full features of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.org<!-- raw HTML omitted --> version, but don&rsquo;t want to deal with the hassle of setting it up, there are many <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hosts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that offer automatic installation (or you can get a WP expert to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->install your blog for free<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if your web host meets the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->requirements<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>\n<p>Last point: you may also choose the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->multi-user version of WP<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if you want the ability to have limitless blogs with unlimited authors with only one installation. It&rsquo;s freely available as well (and, in case you are wondering, it&rsquo;s the same platform used by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WP.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>\n<p>This rest of this review will focus on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress.org<!-- raw HTML omitted --> package because the flexibility inherent in this version most closely approximates the full capabilities of RapidWeaver.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>While RapidWeaver is a website creation tool that also supports blogging, WordPress is first and foremost a tool for the weblog. Sure, you can add static pages to a WP site, but it is primarily designed to handle dynamic content. And it&rsquo;s designed to support things that bloggers need most (moderating comments, managing posts, adding categories and tags etc.) right out of the box. While you can add photo pages, videos, and a variety of other content to your WordPress blog (either in posts or on stand-alone pages), it is generally not as easy of a task as it would be on RapidWeaver. And that&rsquo;s the main difference. If you don&rsquo;t want to pay any money up front, flexibility and customization options are important to you, and you have some (or great) knowledge of CSS and HTML, it&rsquo;s a superb choice. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to know a bit about PHP and MySQL, too. If you don&rsquo;t know anything about this stuff, you will still get a lot out of it because the basic administration tools are quite simple and robust. You just won&rsquo;t be able to customize your site design/layout as much as you might like without a bit of research and studying.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Just like RapidWeaver, WordPress is based on the template (WP calls them themes). As I&rsquo;ve noted before, templates are great because they are generally designed by people who know something about, well, design. Most of the hard work is done for you. However, if you roam far and wide for WP themes, you may find that some of them are not standards-compliant. Most are, though. However, they may no longer be compliant once you&rsquo;re done modifying them. Fortunately, your can test this out compliments of the free <!-- raw HTML omitted -->W3C validation tools<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>In addition to themes, WP offers plug-and-play extendability with plugins and widgets. Plugins are bits of code created by clever individuals that extend your site&rsquo;s functionality. There are a ton of them out there and they are generally extremely easy to deploy. Some of the most popular are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Askimet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (a very effective spam filtering plugin), the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->All in One SEO pack<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; (to easily optimize your site for search engines), <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Analytics<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (to get some site stats), <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress.com stats<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (more stats ‚Äî you need to sign up for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WP.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to use them on your site but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you need a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WP.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-hosted site), and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lightbox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (responsible for the screenshot behavior of this site). But that&rsquo;s just the very tip of a large iceberg. The WordPress <!-- raw HTML omitted -->plugin page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a good place to start your search.</p>\n<p>Widgets are a special type of plugin. They are basically chunks of code that you can mix and match with ease to customize you sidebar content. WordPress comes with a bunch of widgets out of the box (search tool, calendar, recent posts, etc.), but that&rsquo;s just the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->start<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In addition to the standard WP widgets, for instance, this site uses an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->enhanced blogroll<!-- raw HTML omitted --> widget (which rotates links every time the page is loaded), an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->enhanced recent comments<!-- raw HTML omitted --> widget (to display chunks of the most recent comments) and a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feedburner<!-- raw HTML omitted --> widget (to optimize this site&rsquo;s RSS feed).</p>\n<p>Adding plugins, themes, and extra widgets to your site is easy. I&rsquo;ll touch on this in the next section.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p>Inside there, you&rsquo;ll find a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->plugins<!-- raw HTML omitted --> folder, an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->uploads<!-- raw HTML omitted --> folder, and a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->themes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> folder. My assumption here is that you have some sort of FTP client with which to install and view these files. If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll need one. I use Panic&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Transmit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>Installing new themes and plugins couldn&rsquo;t be easier (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->remember: extra widgets are also installed as plugins<!-- raw HTML omitted -->): you drop your new theme files in the themes folder; and (you guessed it) you place plugins in the plugins folder. The uploads folder is a good place to store images and other files that you want to place on pages or in posts. This organization scheme permits you to change themes on the fly while ensuring that your plugins and extra files remain properly in place. In other words, all of the images, files, and plugins are separate from your theme. That way, you can change your theme and your site maintains the same functionality and content, just with a new look.</p>\n<p>All of your posts, comments, tags, etc. are also separate from your theme files ‚Äî they are stored in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MySQL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> database. WordPress works its magic with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PHP<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an open source language that dynamically calls up and displays data and content from your database. It&rsquo;s a bit complicated if you&rsquo;ve never worked with it, but WordPress offers extensive <!-- raw HTML omitted -->documentation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to help you understand how a site is managed. In a nutshell, the theme files control the layout/design and styles of your site (and you can manually add static content in here, too). The theme also contains all the PHP functionality that makes your blog dynamic. If this all sounds complicated, it is. It takes some getting used to. Once you get it down, though, you&rsquo;ll find that WP is perhaps more robust and flexible than RapidWeaver, mainly because all of WP is accessible for modification and the pool of people who make plugins and themes for the WP platform is huge.</p>\n<p>The hardest part to get used to with WP is how the PHP pages are split up into sections (into separate header, footer, index, etc). When you load up a WP blog page, all these disparate parts are called into play via the PHP code and then reassembled on the fly to spit out a dynamically-generated HTML page in your browser. When I first started to understand how all of these PHP files work together (and I confess I don&rsquo;t understand all of it) it struck me as quite ingenious. It reminds me of an analog watch: looked at from the front, it&rsquo;s a stylish, simple interface that tells the time. But open up the back, and you reveal a blur of cogs and springs and little gears somehow working together to create the time. Anyhow, to really get it, be prepared to spend some time with it. My suggestion? Try installing two copies of WP on your web host (one to use for your blog, one to hide and play with) or install <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MAMP<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on your Mac and install a copy of WP there. MAMP, by the way, is a great tool to set up a personal webserver.</p>\n<p>While RapidWeaver content and user options are manipulated on a page-by-page basis and via inspector panes, WordPress is managed from a browser via a web-based Admin panel. The obvious benefit of this approach is that you are not tied to your desktop to manage your site. The Admin panel is the heart and soul of WP. It&rsquo;s designed to give you the tools you need to effectively manage a site, even if you&rsquo;ve never done anything like this before. For the most part, it succeeds. There are many aspects of the admin panel that I really appreciate. For instance, it&rsquo;s very easy to activate and deactivate plugins. It&rsquo;s as simple as turning them off and on. The discussion (comment) moderation is also excellent. You can choose to moderate every comment, just moderate comments from new users, or choose many options in between to get your settings just right. The built in commenting options blow RapidWeaver&rsquo;s external <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Haloscan.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> comment solution out of the water. In fact, many say it&rsquo;s the best of any platform.</p>\n<p>In fact, the level of fidelity with which you can control almost every aspect of your blog is superior. Given this tool is specialized for blogging, perhaps that&rsquo;s not too surprising. You will also appreciate how easy it is to delete or edit a comment, monitor registered users, and move Widgets around (which is a pleasant drag-and-drop experience). You can also email posts in remotely with a few simple set-up steps. Like RapidWeaver, though, some of the admin windows are so chock full of options that it can be confusing to grasp.</p>\n<p>For me, the weak link in the Admin panel is the tab for writing a new post. WP allows you to enter your post via a WYSIWYG or code-based window, but I find it to be clunky and limiting. At times, I&rsquo;ve made changes to my posts via this panel only to find that other parts of my code changed in unexpected ways. I shudder at the thought of typing up a lengthy post (like this one) through the Admin panel. Likewise, I don&rsquo;t care for uploading images or files for my posts via the Admin panel. I think it&rsquo;s tedious; and it&rsquo;s awkward to go back and move or change file names using the panel. My preference for editing and modifying posts? More on that in the next section.</p>\n<p>To summarize the basics: you add themes and plugins by dropping them into folders on your web host using an FTP client; you manage all of your content, presentation options and plugins via the Admin panel; you change the design of your site by modifying the PHP and CSS files of your theme. Easy right? It&rsquo;s actually not as complicated as it may sound, and it&rsquo;s much easier if you use some good third party Mac apps.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Much more so than RapidWeaver, WordPress benefits greatly from the addition of third-party editing tools. For instance, I previously noted that I find writing posts on the web-based Admin panel a little annoying. It&rsquo;s not that the WP Admin panel is bad. It&rsquo;s actually quite good, especially compared to other CMS admin panels I&rsquo;ve used. Still, once I tried <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MarsEdit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I discovered how much better the experience could be. If there is one companion tool that is a must-have for writing, editing, tagging, and categorizing posts, this is it. Some people choose to set up MarsEdit to accurately preview what the post will look like. As I&rsquo;ve mentioned, I post to a local server on my Mac on a mirror copy of this website using MarsEdit. I polish it locally, then publish it once I&rsquo;m done. I find this to be an ideal set up.</p>\n<p>Another third party tool you will need is a good FTP client. This will be useful when you need to update WP to a newer version (make sure you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->back it up<!-- raw HTML omitted --> first!), add new plugins or upload images.</p>\n<p>If you are inclined to create/modify your theme, you will also benefit from an external editor such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TextMate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BBEdit/TextWrangler<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and a CSS editor like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CSSEdit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I don&rsquo;t want to go to deeply into this topic, but I want to point out that WP really rocks when you get a good workflow going with some extra tools. Of course, this comes at a cost. If I add together all of the third party tools I use to manage the site, WP actually cost me about as much as RapidWeaver! I have to ask myself how much of the pleasure of working with WordPress is due to these additional Mac apps. Tools like CSSEdit, TextMate, MarsEdit, and Transmit truly make it a pleasant workflow. In fact, one of the main reasons I stuck with WP for this site is because I really like to use these tools. Sounds kind of silly, perhaps, but I&rsquo;ll stick by it.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s one final tip: you can set up your WordPress admin panel to appear as a desktop application (and put it in your Dock) using a little app called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fluid<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s still in Beta, but I&rsquo;ve found it works great. With Fluid, in fact, you can set up any web-based app to function as a stand-alone application. Very handy.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing about WordPress: it&rsquo;s a question of how far you want to take it. Pretty much anything you want to do is possible, but the need to understand a bit of what&rsquo;s going on with the code behind the scenes increases exponentially the more you deviate from the standard WP model. In this sense, WordPress is an excellent training tool to learn about PHP, MySQL, CSS, and XHMTL. As I&rsquo;ve said, I strongly recommend installing a version locally on your Mac using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MAMP<!-- raw HTML omitted --> just for this purpose. Over time, you&rsquo;ll start to gain the ability to bend your site to your will with greater skill. Until that time, however, you&rsquo;ll be surprised how far you can get with existing themes, plugins and widgets.</p>\n<p>While it&rsquo;s certainly harder to set up (if you do it yourself!) and has a steeper learning curve than RapidWeaver, where you can take your blog with this version of WP is limited only to your ability, imagination and experience level.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>If you are looking for a free and flexible tool to fire up your own blog, WP is a solid choice. It&rsquo;s not only free and flexible, but there are just tons of user-created add-ons that you can quickly drop right in to your site. If you get stuck, you&rsquo;re in luck: the web is rife with tips and tutorials and fixes for WordPress. I haven&rsquo;t come across a problem yet for which I couldn&rsquo;t find a ready-made answer online within a few minutes of searching. The user forums are great and instructions are comprehensive. The last thing I&rsquo;ll note is that WordPress could do a better job at explaining the various options available for new users (.org, .com, multi-user, etc.). It took me a while to sort it out. I hope this review helps some readers make an informed choice.</p>\n<p>That wraps it up. Next, I&rsquo;ll conclude this series with a final summary comparison of RapidWeaver and WordPress.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

I'll touch on this in the next section.\n<h3>The basics of how it works</h3>\nNow let's take a step back and take a deeper look at how WordPress is setup and how you manage it. I'm not going to go into great detail here, but it's important to have a basic understanding of how it's put together. Once you install WP at the desired location on your web host, the first thing you notice is that there are a heck of a lot of files and folders. Fortunately, pretty much everything you need to access is located in one folder labeled <em>wp-content</em>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nInside there, you'll find a <strong>plugins</strong> folder, an <strong>uploads</strong> folder, and a <strong>themes</strong> folder. My assumption here is that you have some sort of FTP client with which to install and view these files. If you don't, you'll need one. I use Panic's <a href=\"http://www.panic.com/transmit/\" target=\"_blank\">Transmit</a>.\n\nInstalling new themes and plugins couldn't be easier (<em>remember: extra widgets are also installed as plugins</em>): you drop your new theme files in the themes folder; and (you guessed it) you place plugins in the plugins folder. The uploads folder is a good place to store images and other files that you want to place on pages or in posts. This organization scheme permits you to change themes on the fly while ensuring that your plugins and extra files remain properly in place. In other words, all of the images, files, and plugins are separate from your theme. That way, you can change your theme and your site maintains the same functionality and content, just with a new look.\n\nAll of your posts, comments, tags, etc. are also separate from your theme files ‚Äî they are stored in a <a href=\"http://www.mysql.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MySQL</a> database. WordPress works its magic with <a href=\"http://www.php.net/\" target=\"_blank\">PHP</a>, an open source language that dynamically calls up and displays data and content from your database. It's a bit complicated if you've never worked with it, but WordPress offers extensive <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> to help you understand how a site is managed. In a nutshell, the theme files control the layout/design and styles of your site (and you can manually add static content in here, too). The theme also contains all the PHP functionality that makes your blog dynamic. If this all sounds complicated, it is. It takes some getting used to. Once you get it down, though, you'll find that WP is perhaps more robust and flexible than RapidWeaver, mainly because all of WP is accessible for modification and the pool of people who make plugins and themes for the WP platform is huge.\n\nThe hardest part to get used to with WP is how the PHP pages are split up into sections (into separate header, footer, index, etc). When you load up a WP blog page, all these disparate parts are called into play via the PHP code and then reassembled on the fly to spit out a dynamically-generated HTML page in your browser. When I first started to understand how all of these PHP files work together (and I confess I don't understand all of it) it struck me as quite ingenious. It reminds me of an analog watch: looked at from the front, it's a stylish, simple interface that tells the time. But open up the back, and you reveal a blur of cogs and springs and little gears somehow working together to create the time. Anyhow, to really get it, be prepared to spend some time with it. My suggestion? Try installing two copies of WP on your web host (one to use for your blog, one to hide and play with) or install <a href=\"http://www.mamp.info/en/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">MAMP</a> on your Mac and install a copy of WP there. MAMP, by the way, is a great tool to set up a personal webserver.\n\nWhile RapidWeaver content and user options are manipulated on a page-by-page basis and via inspector panes, WordPress is managed from a browser via a web-based Admin panel. The obvious benefit of this approach is that you are not tied to your desktop to manage your site. The Admin panel is the heart and soul of WP. It's designed to give you the tools you need to effectively manage a site, even if you've never done anything like this before. For the most part, it succeeds. There are many aspects of the admin panel that I really appreciate. For instance, it's very easy to activate and deactivate plugins. It's as simple as turning them off and on. The discussion (comment) moderation is also excellent. You can choose to moderate every comment, just moderate comments from new users, or choose many options in between to get your settings just right. The built in commenting options blow RapidWeaver's external <a href=\"http://haloscan.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Haloscan.com</a> comment solution out of the water. In fact, many say it's the best of any platform.\n\nIn fact, the level of fidelity with which you can control almost every aspect of your blog is superior. Given this tool is specialized for blogging, perhaps that's not too surprising. You will also appreciate how easy it is to delete or edit a comment, monitor registered users, and move Widgets around (which is a pleasant drag-and-drop experience). You can also email posts in remotely with a few simple set-up steps. Like RapidWeaver, though, some of the admin windows are so chock full of options that it can be confusing to grasp.\n\nFor me, the weak link in the Admin panel is the tab for writing a new post. WP allows you to enter your post via a WYSIWYG or code-based window, but I find it to be clunky and limiting. At times, I've made changes to my posts via this panel only to find that other parts of my code changed in unexpected ways. I shudder at the thought of typing up a lengthy post (like this one) through the Admin panel. Likewise, I don't care for uploading images or files for my posts via the Admin panel. I think it's tedious; and it's awkward to go back and move or change file names using the panel. My preference for editing and modifying posts? More on that in the next section.\n\nTo summarize the basics: you add themes and plugins by dropping them into folders on your web host using an FTP client; you manage all of your content, presentation options and plugins via the Admin panel; you change the design of your site by modifying the PHP and CSS files of your theme. Easy right? It's actually not as complicated as it may sound, and it's much easier if you use some good third party Mac apps.\n<h3>Using Third Party Apps</h3>\n&nbsp;\n\nMuch more so than RapidWeaver, WordPress benefits greatly from the addition of third-party editing tools. For instance, I previously noted that I find writing posts on the web-based Admin panel a little annoying. It's not that the WP Admin panel is bad. It's actually quite good, especially compared to other CMS admin panels I've used. Still, once I tried <a href=\"http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/\" target=\"_blank\">MarsEdit</a> I discovered how much better the experience could be. If there is one companion tool that is a must-have for writing, editing, tagging, and categorizing posts, this is it. Some people choose to set up MarsEdit to accurately preview what the post will look like. As I've mentioned, I post to a local server on my Mac on a mirror copy of this website using MarsEdit. I polish it locally, then publish it once I'm done. I find this to be an ideal set up.\n\nAnother third party tool you will need is a good FTP client. This will be useful when you need to update WP to a newer version (make sure you <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Backups\" target=\"_blank\">back it up</a> first!), add new plugins or upload images.\n\nIf you are inclined to create/modify your theme, you will also benefit from an external editor such as <a href=\"http://macromates.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TextMate</a> or <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BBEdit/TextWrangler</a> and a CSS editor like <a href=\"http://macrabbit.com/cssedit/\" target=\"_blank\">CSSEdit</a>. I don't want to go to deeply into this topic, but I want to point out that WP really rocks when you get a good workflow going with some extra tools. Of course, this comes at a cost. If I add together all of the third party tools I use to manage the site, WP actually cost me about as much as RapidWeaver! I have to ask myself how much of the pleasure of working with WordPress is due to these additional Mac apps. Tools like CSSEdit, TextMate, MarsEdit, and Transmit truly make it a pleasant workflow. In fact, one of the main reasons I stuck with WP for this site is because I really like to use these tools. Sounds kind of silly, perhaps, but I'll stick by it.\n\nHere's one final tip: you can set up your WordPress admin panel to appear as a desktop application (and put it in your Dock) using a little app called <a href=\"http://fluidapp.com/\">Fluid</a>. It's still in Beta, but I've found it works great. With Fluid, in fact, you can set up any web-based app to function as a stand-alone application. Very handy.\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n&nbsp;\n\nSo here's the thing about WordPress: it's a question of how far you want to take it. Pretty much anything you want to do is possible, but the need to understand a bit of what's going on with the code behind the scenes increases exponentially the more you deviate from the standard WP model. In this sense, WordPress is an excellent training tool to learn about PHP, MySQL, CSS, and XHMTL. As I've said, I strongly recommend installing a version locally on your Mac using <a href=\"http://www.mamp.info/en/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">MAMP</a> just for this purpose. Over time, you'll start to gain the ability to bend your site to your will with greater skill. Until that time, however, you'll be surprised how far you can get with existing themes, plugins and widgets.\n\nWhile it's certainly harder to set up (if you do it yourself!) and has a steeper learning curve than RapidWeaver, where you can take your blog with this version of WP is limited only to your ability, imagination and experience level.\n<h4>What do I love about WordPress?</h4>\n¬∫ It's free\n¬∫ It's easy to set up and maintain\n¬∫ Templates, plugins, and widgets abound\n¬∫ The admin panel is full-featured and about as intuitive as any that I've seen\n¬∫ It integrates exceptionally well with other editing tools, particularly MarsEdit\n<h4>What's not to love?</h4>\n¬∫ Compared to RapidWeaver, editing your site styles is more difficult\n¬∫ Editing your theme is even harder for beginners\n¬∫ The built-in WP theme editor is not easy to use\n¬∫ Updating a WP installation takes some patience and knowledge of FTP; it's also a bit scary\n¬∫ Compared to RW, support for adding slick graphics, javascript, video, etc. is certainly not as simple (but there are many plugins to help you along)\n¬∫ Since you can do whatever you want with this WP installation, it's easier to break web standards\n\nIf you are looking for a free and flexible tool to fire up your own blog, WP is a solid choice. It's not only free and flexible, but there are just tons of user-created add-ons that you can quickly drop right in to your site. If you get stuck, you're in luck: the web is rife with tips and tutorials and fixes for WordPress. I haven't come across a problem yet for which I couldn't find a ready-made answer online within a few minutes of searching. The user forums are great and instructions are comprehensive. The last thing I'll note is that WordPress could do a better job at explaining the various options available for new users (.org, .com, multi-user, etc.). It took me a while to sort it out. I hope this review helps some readers make an informed choice.\n\nThat wraps it up. Next, I'll conclude this series with a final summary comparison of RapidWeaver and WordPress.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/6e041dc006.jpg\" /> <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/30af5b70fb.jpg\" /> <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/ae5bfb8e57.jpg\" /> <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/25713b2594.jpg\" /> <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/90bd9ea683.jpg\" /> <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/42912/2021/59544b1504.jpg\" /> \n",

Iguania is a novel application to edit your photos without all of those popup boxes and sliders. Instead, you use the keyboard to select the function you want, then adjust that value with your mouse. I've tried it out and love it. I found it to be quite intuitive. I couldn't help but think of how this idea could be applied to the iPhone/iPod Touch 3-axis accelerometer and the new Apple multi-touch trackpad. Some real innovation happening here. It's still in Beta, so give it a try and send some feedback to the developer.\n<h3>2. Flux:</h3>\nI came across <a href=\"http://www.theescapers.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Flux</a> the other day while perusing my RSS feeds. It's a new website design tool just out of Beta (...and yet already at 1.1.1). I downloaded it, then went to the developer's site to read more. I have to admit it was a bit disconcerting to see the developer blog hosted on a Blogger site. Then I clicked on 'About' and landed on apple.com. Hmm. Still, I pressed on. Thirty minutes later, I concluded that the app has potential but still needs work. It just didn't feel complete to me. I pondered if I should post this or not, but decided I would. I think there are some interesting ideas here ‚Äî the CSS view alone is worth a look.\n",

				"title": "RapidWeaver Vs. WordPress II: RapidWeaver review",
				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Realmac&rsquo;s RapidWeaver<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,\na Mac-only web publishing tool.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iWeb<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (and other CMS solutions), RW is built around the assumption that it&rsquo;s desirable to start out with well-built, professionally-designed, battle-tested templates. This is desirable because (a) most people don&rsquo;t have the time, inclination or ability to produce a site design and (b) templates help ensure that sites meet web standards.</p>\n<p>What I&rsquo;ve just labeled a &lsquo;template&rsquo; in the previous paragraph, RapidWeaver calls a &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->theme<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rsquo; What&rsquo;s the difference? Themes are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->flexible<!-- raw HTML omitted --> templates. For most blogging tools or content management platforms, a user will find a theme he or she likes, apply it to their site and that&rsquo;s pretty much it. The average user may change some basic colors and fonts for a given template, but they typically don&rsquo;t have the ability or the inclination to readily modify much else. A RapidWeaver <!-- raw HTML omitted -->theme<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, on the other hand, empowers the user to really dig in and modify the template to make it his or her own.</p>\n<p>For the novice, themes may be the killer feature of this program. With themes, some of the style variables that may be modified with ease include site colors, font families, page width (to include flexible and fixed width options within one theme), header image, and sidebar position. Most themes also offer several pre-defined styles from which you can choose as well, which is nice for those who have trouble picking complimentary colors or matching thematic elements.</p>\n<p>The customization parameters of a theme are really only limited by how many options the theme developer builds into it. RapidWeaver comes with a slew of nice themes. If you don&rsquo;t find what you like within these options, there are many top-notch <!-- raw HTML omitted -->third-party themes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> available (most will cost you around ten dollars or so, but many are free).</p>\n<p>While most people will use a pre-designed theme, the RealMac developers provide a great <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tutorial and a software development kit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for those who wish to create their own (for their own use, to give away, or to sell). Note for those of you who are interested in creating a theme: RapidWeaver works this magic by saving theme variables within an Apple property list (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->plist<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) file. It&rsquo;s a standard XML file, which makes it a breeze to add to and modify theme properties.</p>\n<p>Conceptually speaking, RapidWeaver places the design and management of your site in the background so you can concentrate on content, content, content. But that&rsquo;s not to say that it doesn&rsquo;t offer robust design/management tools. On the contrary, the app provides very effective management and customization tools, support for search engine optimization and advanced-user options (such as adding your own java, PHP, special assets, or custom CSS on a per-page or site-wide basis). Most of the configuration and customization options are deployed through a plethora of tabbed pop-up windows (commonly referred to as &lsquo;inspectors&rsquo; in Mac parlance). You open them up when you need them; otherwise, you close them up and they stay out of your way.</p>\n<p>All things considered, the developers have created a clean interface to manage just about all aspects of a site ‚Äî which will especially appeal to those new to web development. The idea is that you won&rsquo;t ever need to get at the code behind the scenes (if you don&rsquo;t want to, that is). RW is so confident that most users will never have to mess with underlying code that the developers don&rsquo;t even present an option to view the code through the application&rsquo;s user interface (<!-- raw HTML omitted --> actually, they used to have an option to view the code in earlier versions of the program, but no longer do. This was a good choice because the displayed code in the earlier versions was not directly editable. That was just annoying<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). Not to worry though ‚Äî you can get to the code if you need to. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->UPDATE<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: I&rsquo;ve learned from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RW forums<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can still<!-- raw HTML omitted --> toggle the code view by invoking the shortcut ‚åò-Alt-U.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re used to directly editing style sheets and web code, you may find the &lsquo;RapidWeaver method&rsquo; a little awkward and limiting; the developers took many of the common things you would normally do &lsquo;under the hood&rsquo; and gave them their own front-end user interface. If you&rsquo;ve never hand-coded anything, no need to worry: RW&rsquo;s built-in tools allow even the most novice user to jump right in and start modifying site colors, fonts, sidebar position, site metadata, etc. without ever needing to access the code. There are also some third-party tools you can buy to help you access images for easy modification (see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RWmultitool<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). Alternatively, you can modify a theme by locating it&rsquo;s associated package at <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->/Your User Account/Library/Application Support/RapidWeaver/<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> and opening up the associated HTML and CSS files in the editor of your choice</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The core of this editing area (the main place where you add your content) is the RW <!-- raw HTML omitted -->page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You can add a variety of pages, ranging from a fully-featured blog to straight HTML code. Each page type you choose defines how you add content to that element. If you choose to create a blog page, for instance, the content area is specialized with fields unique to things you need to add for blog entries. Makes sense. If you choose a photo album page, you get a totally different content area, specialized for iPhoto integration and drag-and-drop simplicity. The designers have obviously put a lot of thought into creating simple interfaces for a wide variety of page types. Chances are that you will not need to refer to the manual very often, except when it comes to understanding all of the options in the RW Inspector panes. That is, each page type is associated with a specific inspector pane, and each inspector pane is chock full of customization options.</p>\n<p>While this equates to a platform that allows users to quickly and easily deploy a site, there is a downside. Since RW makes it so easy to publish a site, many users won&rsquo;t bother to (or won&rsquo;t know that they should) fill in site metadata and other details. I have a suggestion for the RealMac developers: it it would be a good idea to provide some tooltips or otherwise-integrated instructions to better explain the myriad customization options available for each page type, the page inspector, and the site inspector.</p>\n<p>For example, it&rsquo;s very quick and easy to create a page. However, it may not be readily apparent to users with no web design experience that you also need to name the folder and file for that page. It would be helpful if the developers built in some sort of warning message when users hit the &lsquo;Publish&rsquo; button as a heads up that some of the parameters have not yet been defined.</p>\n<p>In the example above, for instance, a helpful message might say &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wait! Before you publish your site, you should name your folders and files for the pages you&rsquo;ve created. This is an important step that will make your site easier to index by search engines. It&rsquo;s also necessary for blog entries so your permalinks are meaningful.'<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Or something like that&hellip;</p>\n<p>There are many other examples of instances where tips and other helpful messages would be helpful to ensure the site is properly set up. Imagine you&rsquo;ve never published a website before. You may wonder: What&rsquo;s a meta tag? Why should I worry about this meta stuff? What&rsquo;s &lsquo;page expiration?&rsquo; What&rsquo;s the difference between optimized, tidied, and default code? And so on. I think the program would really benefit from some additional cues to help users along. This, of course, assumes that most people won&rsquo;t read the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->manual<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or dig into the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->forums<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I think that&rsquo;s a safe assumption, especially for an app that draws so many people with little knowledge of these things <!-- raw HTML omitted -->precisely because it&rsquo;s supposed to be so simple to use<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>If you want comments on your blog posts, you need to sign up for this service. And if you sign up for this service, you can manage your comments via HaloScan&rsquo;s web-based interface. You don&rsquo;t need to be at home to do that.</p>\n<p>The other exception? You can buy a third-party blog plugin called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RapidBlog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Loghound.com. RapidBlog is basically a front-end for Google&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blogger<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that seamlessly integrates into RapidWeaver. Using it requires you to sign up for a Blogger account. The only weird thing about it is that your posts will appear both on your website and on your newly-created Blogger site (you can choose to hide your Blogger posts, or you can just leave them there ‚Äî who knows, it may generate more readership for your primary site). If you use RapidBlog, you can remotely edit your posts or email a post from a remote location.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In my opinion, you need to buy some third-party plugins to really get the most out of this application. And one thing I really ike about RW is how well it integrates with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->third-party plugins, add-ons and themes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I mentioned earlier that the RealMac team offers a SDK for themes. Well, they also offer a SDK for anyone who wishes to try their hand at creating a plugin as well. What fun. True, there are many, many great third-party themes out there. But there are also some killer plugins.</p>\n<p>Two complaints I&rsquo;ve heard from RW users is that (a) some plugins should be part of the application from the start and (b) the cost of the plugins quickly exceeds the costs of a RW license. My view? There are some plugins that are so essential, I wouldn&rsquo;t consider RW complete without them. They are just too handy to pass up. I could complain that RealMac should include some of these plugins as core parts of the application, but I honestly don&rsquo;t mind paying for some third-party extended options (note that most of these plugins are different <!-- raw HTML omitted -->page types<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, each with their own Inspector pane full of options and choices). The app is still quite cost-effective, and it&rsquo;s definitely generating some very great third-party software development.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>What&rsquo;s not to like? Well, as I mentioned, a case can be made that RW is feature-weak and not powerful enough, evidenced by all of the third-party plugins. Do you really need these plugins? No, but they will make life easier for you and they are pretty cool. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the RealMac team bought out a few of the add-ons in the future. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yourhead Blocks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for instance, adds <!-- raw HTML omitted --> WYSIWYG<!-- raw HTML omitted --> freeform layout functionality to RapidWeaver. I know that my wife, for one, could not live without it for her site. She&rsquo;s so used to using Blocks, in fact, that she forgot that it&rsquo;s not actually a part of RW.</p>\n<p>Speaking of my wife, I quizzed her on her RW experience as she&rsquo;s the primary user of the app in our household. She reports that the program is, on the whole, a great tool. However, she has faced some problems with the app crashing while she&rsquo;s trying to publish changes to her site. She&rsquo;s taken to closing down all other running programs on the Mac when she&rsquo;s uploading content, which she says helps. She also notes that publishing times can be quite slow, and the site itself is pretty slow on the initial load. These issues have gotten worse as her site has grown. It raises the question of scalability. How big can a RW file get before it becomes unreliable? I trust the developers will keep refining the loading/publishing issues as development moves forth.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve personally noticed that RW can be limiting when it comes to adding or creating complex mixed content on a page. In addition, some things are tricky to do if you want to push the boundaries of a theme or mix up how your content is presented. I can best explain what I&rsquo;m talking about here by way of example. Say you want to add a third column to only one page of a site. This isn&rsquo;t so easy. One solution that many people use is to add a &lsquo;faux&rsquo; column on a Blocks page. That works, but it would be nice to have some themes with one, two, or no column options per page. I&rsquo;m not aware of any limitations that would prevent this.</p>\n<p>As for mixed content, I&rsquo;m referring to the ability to, say, mix in some static content with posts. For example, imagine you want your home page to list your top three newest posts. Above and below this, you wish to add some static content ‚Äî but you still want your main blog to be a separate page in your site. This isn&rsquo;t easy to do. Or imagine that you want to add two columns of static text and maybe some sort of additional javascript to go with your Photo Album page. There are work-arounds to issues such as these (and most rely on third-party plugins!), but I would like to see RealMac push towards more and more flexibility and more choices in the future when it comes to page customization (mixing multiple page types on one page, for example).

				"content_text": "<a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/\" target=\"_blank\">Realmac's RapidWeaver</a>,\na Mac-only web publishing tool.\n<h3>Who is it for?</h3>\nRapidWeaver targets people with little to no web design experience seeking a simple way to produce a professional-looking, standards-compliant, and highly customizable mixed-content website. By 'mixed-content,' I mean that it handles both static and dynamic content. But it's not just for those new to web publishing. It's used by experienced developers, too, because it's a handy way to quickly build and deploy a site with minimal fuss, and it's fairly easy to create custom templates.\n<h3>What is it?</h3>\nIt's a stand-alone web design and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\" target=\"_blank\">Content Management System (CMS)</a> that runs locally from your computer. As a content management tool, the built-in capabilities of this app are easy to use ‚Äî and the user interface is much friendlier than most other web-based content management systems. It's also easier to set up since you don't have to worry about potentially complicated installation procedures. For instance, you don't have to set up a database on your server to get your blog up and running. The down side to this is that you can't manage your content remotely from a web browser (with a few caveats, which I'll go into later). For the most part, you need to be sitting at your Mac when you want to work on your site.\n\nLike <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ilife/iweb/\" target=\"_blank\">iWeb</a> and <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a> (and other CMS solutions), RW is built around the assumption that it's desirable to start out with well-built, professionally-designed, battle-tested templates. This is desirable because (a) most people don't have the time, inclination or ability to produce a site design and (b) templates help ensure that sites meet web standards.\n\nWhat I've just labeled a 'template' in the previous paragraph, RapidWeaver calls a '<em>theme</em>.' What's the difference? Themes are <em>flexible</em> templates. For most blogging tools or content management platforms, a user will find a theme he or she likes, apply it to their site and that's pretty much it. The average user may change some basic colors and fonts for a given template, but they typically don't have the ability or the inclination to readily modify much else. A RapidWeaver <em>theme</em>, on the other hand, empowers the user to really dig in and modify the template to make it his or her own.\n\nFor the novice, themes may be the killer feature of this program. With themes, some of the style variables that may be modified with ease include site colors, font families, page width (to include flexible and fixed width options within one theme), header image, and sidebar position. Most themes also offer several pre-defined styles from which you can choose as well, which is nice for those who have trouble picking complimentary colors or matching thematic elements.\n\nThe customization parameters of a theme are really only limited by how many options the theme developer builds into it. RapidWeaver comes with a slew of nice themes. If you don't find what you like within these options, there are many top-notch <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/addons/index.php?type=theme&amp;rw_vers ion=\" target=\"_blank\">third-party themes</a> available (most will cost you around ten dollars or so, but many are free).\n\nWhile most people will use a pre-designed theme, the RealMac developers provide a great <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/developers.php\" target=\"_blank\">tutorial and a software development kit</a> for those who wish to create their own (for their own use, to give away, or to sell). Note for those of you who are interested in creating a theme: RapidWeaver works this magic by saving theme variables within an Apple property list (<strong>plist</strong>) file. It's a standard XML file, which makes it a breeze to add to and modify theme properties.\n\nConceptually speaking, RapidWeaver places the design and management of your site in the background so you can concentrate on content, content, content. But that's not to say that it doesn't offer robust design/management tools. On the contrary, the app provides very effective management and customization tools, support for search engine optimization and advanced-user options (such as adding your own java, PHP, special assets, or custom CSS on a per-page or site-wide basis). Most of the configuration and customization options are deployed through a plethora of tabbed pop-up windows (commonly referred to as 'inspectors' in Mac parlance). You open them up when you need them; otherwise, you close them up and they stay out of your way.\n\nAll things considered, the developers have created a clean interface to manage just about all aspects of a site ‚Äî which will especially appeal to those new to web development. The idea is that you won't ever need to get at the code behind the scenes (if you don't want to, that is). RW is so confident that most users will never have to mess with underlying code that the developers don't even present an option to view the code through the application's user interface (<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"> actually, they used to have an option to view the code in earlier versions of the program, but no longer do. This was a good choice because the displayed code in the earlier versions was not directly editable. That was just annoying</span>). Not to worry though ‚Äî you can get to the code if you need to. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: I've learned from the <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/support/viewtopic.php?pid=212776#p212776\">RW forums</a> that you <strong>can still</strong> toggle the code view by invoking the shortcut ‚åò-Alt-U.\n\nIf you're used to directly editing style sheets and web code, you may find the 'RapidWeaver method' a little awkward and limiting; the developers took many of the common things you would normally do 'under the hood' and gave them their own front-end user interface. If you've never hand-coded anything, no need to worry: RW's built-in tools allow even the most novice user to jump right in and start modifying site colors, fonts, sidebar position, site metadata, etc. without ever needing to access the code. There are also some third-party tools you can buy to help you access images for easy modification (see <a href=\"http://www.rwmultitool.com/\">RWmultitool</a>). Alternatively, you can modify a theme by locating it's associated package at <em><strong>/Your User Account/Library/Application Support/RapidWeaver/</strong></em> and opening up the associated HTML and CSS files in the editor of your choice\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>The workflow</h3>\nThe RW workflow is simple: you choose a template, you add pages, you publish it to your web host. All you need to get started is a copy of RW, a remote web host and an FTP or .Mac account. What makes it special is how easy it is to do this, the good looks of the resulting site and the versatility of the 'theme' framework. RW also stands out in terms of how quickly you can deploy a site. How fast is it? It depends on how much customization you want to do. I was able to launch a site with a blog, multiple static pages and a photo album page in about 30 minutes. That's not too bad. I set up a fairly complex website for my wife that features a blog, dozens of static pages, customized graphics, and a highly modified template in about 6 hours of non-contiguous work. That's pretty good, too.\n\nThe core of this editing area (the main place where you add your content) is the RW <strong>page</strong>. You can add a variety of pages, ranging from a fully-featured blog to straight HTML code. Each page type you choose defines how you add content to that element. If you choose to create a blog page, for instance, the content area is specialized with fields unique to things you need to add for blog entries. Makes sense. If you choose a photo album page, you get a totally different content area, specialized for iPhoto integration and drag-and-drop simplicity. The designers have obviously put a lot of thought into creating simple interfaces for a wide variety of page types. Chances are that you will not need to refer to the manual very often, except when it comes to understanding all of the options in the RW Inspector panes. That is, each page type is associated with a specific inspector pane, and each inspector pane is chock full of customization options.\n\nWhile this equates to a platform that allows users to quickly and easily deploy a site, there is a downside. Since RW makes it so easy to publish a site, many users won't bother to (or won't know that they should) fill in site metadata and other details. I have a suggestion for the RealMac developers: it it would be a good idea to provide some tooltips or otherwise-integrated instructions to better explain the myriad customization options available for each page type, the page inspector, and the site inspector.\n\nFor example, it's very quick and easy to create a page. However, it may not be readily apparent to users with no web design experience that you also need to name the folder and file for that page. It would be helpful if the developers built in some sort of warning message when users hit the 'Publish' button as a heads up that some of the parameters have not yet been defined.\n\nIn the example above, for instance, a helpful message might say '<em>Wait! Before you publish your site, you should name your folders and files for the pages you've created. This is an important step that will make your site easier to index by search engines. It's also necessary for blog entries so your permalinks are meaningful.'</em> Or something like that...\n\nThere are many other examples of instances where tips and other helpful messages would be helpful to ensure the site is properly set up. Imagine you've never published a website before. You may wonder: What's a meta tag? Why should I worry about this meta stuff? What's 'page expiration?' What's the difference between optimized, tidied, and default code? And so on. I think the program would really benefit from some additional cues to help users along. This, of course, assumes that most people won't read the <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/helpdesk/\">manual</a> or dig into the <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/support/index.php\">forums</a>. I think that's a safe assumption, especially for an app that draws so many people with little knowledge of these things <em>precisely because it's supposed to be so simple to use</em>.\n<h3>Remote management (for Bloggers only)</h3>\nI mentioned that there were a couple of caveats to the statement that \"you can't manage your site remotely.\" There are two exceptions that I know of. The first is with the built-in RW blog: while you can't manage your blog posts remotely, you can manage your comments remotely. That's because RealMac partners with <a href=\"http://www.haloscan.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HaloScan</a>, a third-party commenting system, to deliver blog comments.\n\nIf you want comments on your blog posts, you need to sign up for this service. And if you sign up for this service, you can manage your comments via HaloScan's web-based interface. You don't need to be at home to do that.\n\nThe other exception? You can buy a third-party blog plugin called <a href=\"http://www.loghound.com/rapidblog/\" target=\"_blank\">RapidBlog</a> from Loghound.com. RapidBlog is basically a front-end for Google's <a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/start\" target=\"_blank\">Blogger</a> that seamlessly integrates into RapidWeaver. Using it requires you to sign up for a Blogger account. The only weird thing about it is that your posts will appear both on your website and on your newly-created Blogger site (you can choose to hide your Blogger posts, or you can just leave them there ‚Äî who knows, it may generate more readership for your primary site). If you use RapidBlog, you can remotely edit your posts or email a post from a remote location.\n<h3>The Small Print</h3>\nRapidWeaver has been around since 2004 (the same year that WordPress hit the streets, incidentally). It's now at version 3.6.5. Note that this app is not free or open-source (like WordPress). RW costs $49 per license. That's pretty cheap, but if you want to really take it to another level, you're going to want some third-party add-ons. And when you decide to buy some, you'll soon discover that it's not as cheap as it first appears.\n\nIn my opinion, you need to buy some third-party plugins to really get the most out of this application. And one thing I really ike about RW is how well it integrates with <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/addons/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">third-party plugins, add-ons and themes</a>. I mentioned earlier that the RealMac team offers a SDK for themes. Well, they also offer a SDK for anyone who wishes to try their hand at creating a plugin as well. What fun. True, there are many, many great third-party themes out there. But there are also some killer plugins.\n\nTwo complaints I've heard from RW users is that (a) some plugins should be part of the application from the start and (b) the cost of the plugins quickly exceeds the costs of a RW license. My view? There are some plugins that are so essential, I wouldn't consider RW complete without them. They are just too handy to pass up. I could complain that RealMac should include some of these plugins as core parts of the application, but I honestly don't mind paying for some third-party extended options (note that most of these plugins are different <strong>page types</strong>, each with their own Inspector pane full of options and choices). The app is still quite cost-effective, and it's definitely generating some very great third-party software development.\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\nI think RapidWeaver is a tool with a great future. It offers slick themes, powerful customization options, ease of use, a dedicated user base (check out the <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/support/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">RW User Forum</a> when you get stuck), and top-notch third party add-ons. It's cheap. It's easy for novices to use. It's fun for more experienced people to use.\n\nWhat's not to like? Well, as I mentioned, a case can be made that RW is feature-weak and not powerful enough, evidenced by all of the third-party plugins. Do you really need these plugins? No, but they will make life easier for you and they are pretty cool. I wouldn't be surprised if the RealMac team bought out a few of the add-ons in the future. <a href=\"http://www.yourhead.com/blocks/\" target=\"_blank\">Yourhead Blocks</a>, for instance, adds <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"> WYSIWYG</span> freeform layout functionality to RapidWeaver. I know that my wife, for one, could not live without it for her site. She's so used to using Blocks, in fact, that she forgot that it's not actually a part of RW.\n\nSpeaking of my wife, I quizzed her on her RW experience as she's the primary user of the app in our household. She reports that the program is, on the whole, a great tool. However, she has faced some problems with the app crashing while she's trying to publish changes to her site. She's taken to closing down all other running programs on the Mac when she's uploading content, which she says helps. She also notes that publishing times can be quite slow, and the site itself is pretty slow on the initial load. These issues have gotten worse as her site has grown. It raises the question of scalability. How big can a RW file get before it becomes unreliable? I trust the developers will keep refining the loading/publishing issues as development moves forth.\n\nI've personally noticed that RW can be limiting when it comes to adding or creating complex mixed content on a page. In addition, some things are tricky to do if you want to push the boundaries of a theme or mix up how your content is presented. I can best explain what I'm talking about here by way of example. Say you want to add a third column to only one page of a site. This isn't so easy. One solution that many people use is to add a 'faux' column on a Blocks page. That works, but it would be nice to have some themes with one, two, or no column options per page. I'm not aware of any limitations that would prevent this.\n\nAs for mixed content, I'm referring to the ability to, say, mix in some static content with posts. For example, imagine you want your home page to list your top three newest posts. Above and below this, you wish to add some static content ‚Äî but you still want your main blog to be a separate page in your site. This isn't easy to do. Or imagine that you want to add two columns of static text and maybe some sort of additional javascript to go with your Photo Album page. There are work-arounds to issues such as these (and most rely on third-party plugins!), but I would like to see RealMac push towards more and more flexibility and more choices in the future when it comes to page customization (mixing multiple page types on one page, for example). I'd also like a way to open up the core theme files from within the application for quick edits. Of course, that's a tall order since they are also trying to keep things simple with this app. My suggestion? How about two versions set at two different price points: RapidWeaver Standard and Pro?\n\nI'll close by noting that it's a tool that certainly rewards the patient user ‚Äî I mentioned that RW has a good user forum, and this is where you should head first to answer any questions you have, or to see if anyone has already posted a fix for a vexing problem you may be having. It's a vibrant, friendly community and if you have an issue, chances are it's already being discussed.\n\nFor the next installment in this series, I'll present an overview of Wordpress. Then, in the final post, I'll compare the two based on some criteria of my invention. Cheers.\n\n<strong>Postscript</strong>: A forgot to mention Snippets! This is one of the coolest parts of RapidWeaver. This is a simple but powerful feature: open up your Snippets inspector pane to reveal stored bits of code. Drag and drop these 'snippets' directly onto your page.

				"content_text": "So, here's my latest Dvorak-Qwerty keyboard support rant.\n\nI received a very odd 'personal' response from an Adobe customer support representative regarding my request for Dvorak-Qwerty support for Adobe's Creative Suite applications.\n\n<strong>My complaint</strong>: Dvorak-Qwerty does not properly work with Adobe products.\n\n(See my <a href=\"/2007/11/24/dvorak-users-of-the-world-unite/\">previous post</a> for background on DQ if you have no idea what I'm talking about)\n\n<strong>Here's a snippet from what I wrote to Adobe about this annoying problem</strong>:\n<blockquote><em>I must toggle to the QWERTY layout to use my shortcuts, then toggle back to Dvorak when I need to type. This is very annoying. Would Adobe consider posting a relatively minor update to address those users who rely on the Dvorak-Qwerty keyboard layout in Mac OS X?</em></blockquote>\n<strong>They wrote back to me today (within 24 hours, as promised on their website)</strong>:\n<blockquote><em>I understand that you would like Adobe to post a minor update for Macintosh users who rely on Dvorak-Qwerty keyboard, as you have to continually toggle between these two keyboards in order to use it to type text and use short cut keys respectively.</em>\n\n<em>I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused.</em>\n\n<em>We need to inform you that Adobe¬Æ Systems continually develops new applications and improves existing products, but cannot comment on unreleased products until a press release is posted. When new releases become available, the details regarding new features and purchasing information will be posted on the Adobe Web site at the following URL: [www.adobe.com](http://www.adobe.com)</em></blockquote>\nOk. So they seem to grasp the issue, but then again ... the response mimicked the phrases from my complaint so closely that it left me with the distinct impression that some sort of AI compiled and regurgitated a customized automated response based on my input. The part that annoys me most is that the automated response tries too hard to appear like it came from a real human. Or perhaps what annoys me is that it doesn't seem like it came from a real human, but Adobe would like me to feel as if it did.\n\nI can't say that I expect to see a software update from Adobe that addresses my issue anytime soon.

Is a quick reply better than a delayed reply (or no reply at all) if it is canned and impersonal? Is it actually worse if it's canned and impersonal and it attempts to be personalized in a very fake way?\n\nIn addition to the mimicry of my original complaint, the 'personal' message also included my name at awkward intervals throughout the response. Here's an example:\n<blockquote><em>Troy, also, please visit the following URL on the Adobe Web site for the latest customer service and technical information: [www.adobe.com](http://www.adobe.com)/support/main.html</em></blockquote>\nAnd later on in the (relatively short) message:\n<blockquote><em>Troy, the Web Support Portal Representatives are available from Monday to Friday.</em></blockquote>\nI'm convinced that a human would not reference my first name repeatedly in such an awkward manner.\n\nThe Adobe response was signed by 'Victor M.' of Adobe Customer Service. I'm sure that Victor M. exists, but he surely would not have typed out such a weird response to a customer. I really wouldn't expect a human to type out a detailed response within 24 hours from such a massive company. It had to be a generated response. So what's my point? If Adobe is committed to a personalized, rapid customer response, I would rather receive a message that said:\n<blockquote>'<em>Hi Troy, we get a bazillion comments and suggestions every week. We got your message. A real human will read it. We will consider your input.</em>'</blockquote>\nA week or two later, perhaps I would get a message that said:\n<blockquote>'<em>Hey Troy, We read your input. We understand that you've submitted a feature request about our support for Dvorak-Qwerty. It may be part of a future Adobe release, but we can't make any promises. We'll do our best. We're considering it. Really. Please understand that we have a bazillion other feature requests already in the queue, so your input will be addressed in the order it was received since we've determined that it's not a critical application error.</em>'</blockquote>\nMaybe it's just me, but I'd rather see a response like that. To be fair, perhaps the response I received wasn't automated. Perhaps Victor M. used creative cut-n-paste to respond to my query. Still, it seemed disingenuous; it seemed like a cookie-cutter response cloaked in a 'personalized' message. It seemed, in other words, automated in the worst way.\n\nIf any of you reading this are Dvorak typists who use QWERTY shortcuts (and use Adobe apps), please consider dropping them a note. Maybe all ten of us will get them to consider updating their software...\n",

				"title": "Back to Basics: Top Nine tips for new Mac users",
				"content_html": "<p>This is my first post in a new category I&rsquo;m calling &lsquo;back to basics.&rsquo; With all the new Mac users out there, I&rsquo;ve decided to periodically post some tips aimed at this crowd ‚Äî a group that includes many of my friends who&rsquo;ve crossed over from the PC. To get the ball rolling, I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of nine tips for new Mac users. If you have a tip to share, leave a comment to round off this list at an even ten.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It&rsquo;s about more than learning the differences between a &lsquo;Dock&rsquo; and a &lsquo;Start&rsquo; menu, or &lsquo;System Preferences&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Control Panel&rsquo; ‚Äî understanding Mac OS X is about changing the way you think about using your computer. While built-in Mac OS X &lsquo;help files&rsquo; are available to answer basic questions, it&rsquo;s hard for new users to get the big picture through help files alone. This documentation tends to be short and is often devoid of context.</p>\n<p>For those new to the Mac, I think it&rsquo;s worth the money and effort to buy a third-party manual to keep at hand for quick and easy reference. A book offers depth, context, and examples in a package that won&rsquo;t get in your way while you&rsquo;re working on your Mac. Sure, you can find just about anything you want to know through an online search or user forums, but a well-written book will help you break your PC habits and more quickly adapt to the Mac environment. Maybe I&rsquo;m old fashioned, but I think it&rsquo;s generally easier to learn from a book. You can prop it open to a dog-eared page, highlight it, tab it with stickies, and generally abuse it. Most importantly, you don&rsquo;t need to navigate away from what your doing to get some help.</p>\n<p>I recommend David Pogue&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac OS X Leopard: The Missing Manual<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I also like TidBIT&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TakeControl<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Ebooks, a series of downloadable PDF booklets that are cheap and full of great info (you can print them out or view them online). If you are a more visual type of person and want to learn how to use your Mac (and many great applications) by watching videos, be sure to check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ScreenCastsOnline<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>Apple also offers some good online resources. Be sure to check out Apple&rsquo;s online help files: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Switch 101<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac 101<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Find Out How<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rsquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>However, I&rsquo;ve discovered that many ex-PC users fret about downloading software from third-party sites because they fear viruses, trojans, spyware, and other nasty stuff. All I can say is that Mac apps are generally very safe (by &lsquo;generally&rsquo; I mean that there have been no viruses, trojans, spyware, etc. thus far embedded in third-party Mac software that I am aware of, but it won&rsquo;t necessarily stay that way)&hellip; and users who ignore third-party Mac apps are arguably missing out on the best part of the Mac experience. The key is to only use trusted sources as you seek out new apps. A few trusted sources I use are: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MacUpdate<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->versiontracker<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iusethis<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Need a way to keep your applications up to date? Try MetaQuark&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AppFresh<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->*<!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I personally use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Launchbar<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but it isn&rsquo;t free)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>By way of example, a friend of mine downloaded Handbrake one night based on my recommendation to format/convert some of his DVDs to use on his new iPhone. The next day, he complained that the app was extremely slow and created a &lsquo;blank&rsquo; file that didn&rsquo;t open up in any application. The problem? He was running Handbrake from within the disk image. He didn&rsquo;t realize he needed to drag it to his applications folder prior to using it. It&rsquo;s easy for long-time Mac users to laugh at this mistake, but consider it from my friend&rsquo;s perspective. How would he know?</p>\n<p>But what about deleting? If you don&rsquo;t want an application anymore, drag it the trash. That&rsquo;s it. You&rsquo;re done. Use the same method to delete files. Want to delete things even faster? Try this key combo: ?-delete. If you want to keep you Mac as tidy as possible, consider the free <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AppDelete<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or the shareware <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AppZapper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. These apps clean out additional items that are left behind when you drag apps to the trash. Not that these additional items will hurt anything if you leave them ‚Äî it generally doesn&rsquo;t really matter much. Still, it&rsquo;s a good practice to delete all the associated bits and scraps of a program when you&rsquo;re done with it. Down the road, you&rsquo;ll be glad you did.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Most importantly, &lsquo;Get Info&rsquo; is where you&rsquo;ll find permissions that govern who can do what with your files (you decide who can Read, Write, and Execute). Need a tutorial? Check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this Macworld article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple documentation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>But there&rsquo;s a better way. Longtime Mac users tend to be oddly fanatical about shortcut keys, and Mac applications reflect this: each Mac application you install will have a seemingly endless list of shortcuts. Why bother learning key-combo shortcuts? Speed and efficiency are clear benefits, but shortcuts also help you avoid repetitive stress from using the Mouse.</p>\n<p>Here are a just a few you shortcuts you should consider learning right away:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>With Mac OS X, there are easier ways to navigate. Try the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Expose<!-- raw HTML omitted --> keys. Try <!-- raw HTML omitted -->?-tab<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (tab through open applications). Try <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spaces<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Try some of the great Mac application launchers (see #8 above). Use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spotlight<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The last one I&rsquo;ll point out here is a little freeware preference pane to toggle between open windows within one application with ease ‚Äî it&rsquo;s called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Witch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and it&rsquo;s made by the same guy who created Butler.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Check out Apple&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac Maintenance Quick Assist<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, how to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->manually<!-- raw HTML omitted --> initiate maintenance tasks, and Macworld&rsquo;s dated but still very relevant article on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->preventing Mac disasters<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You may also want to consider investing in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cocktail<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s not free, but it&rsquo;s cheap, simple to use, helpful, and is an excellent maintenance Mac app. New Mac users should also consider the expensive but essential <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DiskWarrior<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You may not need it often, but when you do need it &hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you really need it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>My last point: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reboot<!-- raw HTML omitted --> every now and then. My father-in-law recently visited with his Macbook in tow. He complained that some of his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniWeb<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->*<!-- raw HTML omitted --> links were no longer working and his machine was generally acting strange. When I opened up his laptop, it whirred to life. When I say &lsquo;whirred,&rsquo; I mean it was really noisy. Fans were blowing hard. Hard drive was cranking. My solution? I rebooted. Everything worked fine after that. It was silent once more. It turned out he had the computer in sleep mode for over half a year ‚Äî since his last visit he had never rebooted. A system reboot at least once a month is a good way to clear out any weird or corrupt processes that may be running.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->*<!-- raw HTML omitted -->(stay tuned for a future post on why I bought OmniWeb for my father-in-law)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>How far you take it depends on how adventurous you are, but even the most conservative of users should try out a bit of customization. It&rsquo;s your Mac, after all.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s one small <!-- raw HTML omitted -->example<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Here&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->another<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Here&rsquo;s yet <!-- raw HTML omitted -->another<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. A good starting point to see how fun and\nuseful this can be is the free <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tinkertool<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Marcel Bresink. The list is endless - explore forums, Mac sites, etc. and enjoy. Be careful though. It can be addicting.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>This first account is the one to use on a daily basis. With your <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Standard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> account, you will be prompted to enter your Admin account name and password every time you install new software, change system preferences, etc. It&rsquo;s a bit of a pain, but it&rsquo;s a lot more secure. For Leopard users, be sure to check out the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sharing Only<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; account (great choice when you have relatives visiting who want to use your Mac) and &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Managed with Parental Controls<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; (great choice, of course, for kids). Oh, and make a note to ensure that your Mac Firewall is turned on (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->System Preferences &gt; Security &gt; Firewall<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)&hellip;inexplicably, the Firewall is turned off by default for users who upgrade from Tiger to Leopard.</p>\n<p>And what if you forget your Admin password? Fortunately, there is an easy fix. All you need to do is stick your OS X installation disk in your CD/DVD drive, restart your computer, and hold down &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; key as it restarts (<!-- raw HTML omitted --> remember this with C = CD-ROM<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). You can let go of the &lsquo;C&rsquo; when you hear your CD/DVD drive whir to life. In time, a window will appear that asks you to select a user language. Then, as the next window pops open, you&rsquo;ll notice that there are now some menu options up in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple menu ba<!-- raw HTML omitted -->r (top of the screen). Choose &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Utilities<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; (if you are running 10.4 Tiger or 10.5 Leopard) or &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Installer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; (for earlier versions of the Mac OS). Then choose &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reset Password<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rsquo; Follow the simple instructions to choose a new password for the account of your choice, then quit the installation process (from the &lsquo;Installer&rsquo; menu in the Menu Bar) and restart your computer without holding down &lsquo;C.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s it.</p>\n<p>While it&rsquo;s great that it&rsquo;s so easy to reset an admin password, it&rsquo;s also kind of scary. What it means is that anyone with an installation disc and access to your machine can quite easily reset your admin password and access your files. The moral: if you have data that you don&rsquo;t want anyone to see under any circumstances, you will want to explore ways to encrypt this data and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->protect your mac<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The other important point to make here: ensure you have a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->backup<!-- raw HTML omitted --> before doing this, just in case.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s it for now.

Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I think it's generally easier to learn from a book. You can prop it open to a dog-eared page, highlight it, tab it with stickies, and generally abuse it. Most importantly, you don't need to navigate away from what your doing to get some help.\n\nI recommend David Pogue's <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529529/\">Mac OS X Leopard: The Missing Manual</a>. I also like TidBIT's <a href=\"http://www.takecontrolbooks.com/\">TakeControl</a> Ebooks, a series of downloadable PDF booklets that are cheap and full of great info (you can print them out or view them online). If you are a more visual type of person and want to learn how to use your Mac (and many great applications) by watching videos, be sure to check out <a href=\"http://www.screencastsonline.com/sco/\">ScreenCastsOnline</a>.\n\nApple also offers some good online resources. Be sure to check out Apple's online help files: <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/support/switch101/switcher/\">Switch 101</a>, <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/support/mac101/\">Mac 101</a>, and '<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/findouthow/macosx/\">Find Out How</a>.'\n<h3>8. Explore Mac third-party software.</h3>\nWhen one of my friends gets a new Mac, I'm quick to point out a few 'must have' <em>free</em> apps that they should consider loading up right away as they get started on the new OS. Here are a few: <a href=\"http://www.blacktree.com/\">QuickSilver</a> or <a href=\"http://www.manytricks.com/butler/\">Butler</a> <strong>*</strong> to launch applications and handily complete routine tasks , <a href=\"http://www.perian.org/\">Perian</a> to view just about anything with the QuickTime player, <a href=\"http://www.videolan.org/vlc/\">VLC</a> to view anything else, <a href=\"http://www.titanium.free.fr/pgs2/english/download.html\">Onyx</a> to maintain the Mac, <a href=\"http://handbrake.fr/\">Handbrake</a> to convert your DVDs to different formats.\n\nHowever, I've discovered that many ex-PC users fret about downloading software from third-party sites because they fear viruses, trojans, spyware, and other nasty stuff. All I can say is that Mac apps are generally very safe (by 'generally' I mean that there have been no viruses, trojans, spyware, etc. thus far embedded in third-party Mac software that I am aware of, but it won't necessarily stay that way)... and users who ignore third-party Mac apps are arguably missing out on the best part of the Mac experience. The key is to only use trusted sources as you seek out new apps. A few trusted sources I use are: <a href=\"http://www.macupdate.com/\">MacUpdate</a>, <a href=\"http://www.versiontracker.com/macosx/\">versiontracker</a>, and <a href=\"http://osx.iusethis.com/\">iusethis</a>. Need a way to keep your applications up to date? Try MetaQuark's <a href=\"http://metaquark.de/appfresh/\">AppFresh</a>.\n\n<em><strong>*</strong>(I personally use <a href=\"http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html\">Launchbar</a> but it isn't free)</em>\n<h3>7. Learn how to install/uninstall applications and delete stuff</h3>\nSo, you just downloaded a Mac application. Now what? While some Mac apps include installers that function similar to Windows installation packages, most do not. When you download Mac software, what you're likely to get is '<a href=\"http://guides.macrumors.com/Disk_image\">Disk Image</a>.' Think of a disk image as a 'virtual disk.' What you need to do is click on the disk image to open it up (it will likely open up automatically after you download it ‚Äî don't panic). The disk image is now 'mounted' and will appear on your desktop. If you don't see a disk image, chances are the application is zipped up in another compression format and the disk image is contained within that zipped up file. Why? Developers like to distribute their software with small file sizes. The way to do that is to tightly compress them. Here are some <a href=\"http://guides.macrumors.com/Installing_Applications_in_Mac_OS_X#Disk_images\">basic instructions</a> regarding the vaunted .dmg file. To many Mac users, this tip may seem too obvious. But I maintain that it's not obvious at all if you've never done it before.\n\nBy way of example, a friend of mine downloaded Handbrake one night based on my recommendation to format/convert some of his DVDs to use on his new iPhone. The next day, he complained that the app was extremely slow and created a 'blank' file that didn't open up in any application. The problem? He was running Handbrake from within the disk image. He didn't realize he needed to drag it to his applications folder prior to using it. It's easy for long-time Mac users to laugh at this mistake, but consider it from my friend's perspective. How would he know?\n\nBut what about deleting? If you don't want an application anymore, drag it the trash. That's it. You're done. Use the same method to delete files. Want to delete things even faster? Try this key combo: ?-delete. If you want to keep you Mac as tidy as possible, consider the free <a href=\"http://reggie.ashworth.googlepages.com/appdelete\">AppDelete</a> or the shareware <a href=\"http://appzapper.com/\">AppZapper</a>. These apps clean out additional items that are left behind when you drag apps to the trash. Not that these additional items will hurt anything if you leave them ‚Äî it generally doesn't really matter much. Still, it's a good practice to delete all the associated bits and scraps of a program when you're done with it. Down the road, you'll be glad you did.\n<h3>6. Take the time to understand Permissions</h3>\n'Get Info' is like Windows 'Properties.' You access it by rig\nht-clicking on any file, folder, or application. You'll find a lot of useful information here, including metadata like size, creation date, when the file/folder/app was last modified or last opened, where it's located, and a preview of the icon associated with the folder/file (tip: you can <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304735\">change the icon</a> for any item via the 'Get Info' pane, which is fun).\n\nMost importantly, 'Get Info' is where you'll find permissions that govern who can do what with your files (you decide who can Read, Write, and Execute). Need a tutorial? Check out <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/49831/2006/03/tcopermissions.html\">this Macworld article</a> and this <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106712\">Apple documentation</a>.\n<h3>5. Learn some shortcut keys</h3>\nSure, there are shortcut keys for Windows (generally, you substitute the <strong>CTRL</strong> key for Apple's <strong>?</strong>). But in my experience most Windows users turn to the mouse (<em>right-click menu</em>) or the <strong>Menu Bar</strong> to access basic commands like copy, paste, save, etc. Sure, you can do this on a Mac, too.\n\nBut there's a better way. Longtime Mac users tend to be oddly fanatical about shortcut keys, and Mac applications reflect this: each Mac application you install will have a seemingly endless list of shortcuts. Why bother learning key-combo shortcuts? Speed and efficiency are clear benefits, but shortcuts also help you avoid repetitive stress from using the Mouse.\n\nHere are a just a few you shortcuts you should consider learning right away:\n<blockquote><strong>? -tab</strong> (tab through open applications)\n<strong>? -A/C/V</strong> (select all, copy, paste)\n<strong>? -W</strong> (close the current window in an application)\n<strong>? -Q</strong> (quit application)\n<strong>? -S</strong> (save)</blockquote>\nHere's a <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=75459\">cheat sheet</a> for standard Apple shortcuts. It's important to point out that shortcuts are also built-in to all of the applications on your Mac. Some apps may have literally dozens of key-combinations to help you work faster. If the thought of learning so many shortcuts makes your head hurt, consider Ergonis <a href=\"http://www.ergonis.com/products/keycue/\">KeyCue</a>. This handy little app is a bit expensive, but it's a clever way to learn new key combinations. Once KeyCue is installed, every time you hit the ? key, a menu pops up that displays all available shortcuts for your current application. Soon, you'll wonder how you ever got along without complex combos like Adobe PhotoShop's shift-option-?-S (which opens up the '<em>Save for Web &amp; Devices</em>' dialogue box, if you're curious).\n<h3>4. Learn new ways to navigate</h3>\nMac navigation is different from PC navigation. One thing PC users will notice right away is that Mac application windows float on the desktop in self-contained little boxes that can be moved around at will. While I know that this may be unnerving for some Windows users, trust me: in time it becomes liberating.\nWhat I hate to see is ex-Windows users dragging windows out of the way to 'peek' behind to other windows in the background.\n\nWith Mac OS X, there are easier ways to navigate. Try the <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304786\">Expose</a> keys. Try <strong>?-tab</strong> (tab through open applications). Try <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spaces.html\">Spaces</a>. Try some of the great Mac application launchers (see #8 above). Use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_(software)\">Spotlight</a>. The last one I'll point out here is a little freeware preference pane to toggle between open windows within one application with ease ‚Äî it's called <a href=\"http://www.manytricks.com/witch/\">Witch</a> and it's made by the same guy who created Butler.\n<h3>3. Understand how to take care of your Mac</h3>\nMany new Mac users express shock and dismay the first time something goes wrong. The truth is that the Mac OS requires a little TLC. While I have never experienced the level of frustration, rage, and resignation I felt as a Windows user (I used to consider it normal to wipe out my hard drive and reinstall everything from scratch once or twice a year), that is not to say that the Mac OS is perfect. Far from it. That's why it's a good idea to learn some basic steps to keep your machine humming.\n\nCheck out Apple's <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303602\">Mac Maintenance Quick Assist</a>, how to <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=107388\">manually</a> initiate maintenance tasks, and Macworld's dated but still very relevant article on <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/42286/2005/01/preventmacdisasters.html\">preventing Mac disasters</a>. You may also want to consider investing in <a href=\"http://www.maintain.se/cocktail/index.php\">Cocktail</a>. It's not free, but it's cheap, simple to use, helpful, and is an excellent maintenance Mac app. New Mac users should also consider the expensive but essential <a href=\"http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/\">DiskWarrior</a>. You may not need it often, but when you do need it ... <em>you really need it</em>.\n\nMy last point: <strong>reboot</strong> every now and then. My father-in-law recently visited with his Macbook in tow. He complained that some of his <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/\">OmniWeb</a> <strong>*</strong> links were no longer working and his machine was generally acting strange. When I opened up his laptop, it whirred to life. When I say 'whirred,' I mean it was really noisy. Fans were blowing hard. Hard drive was cranking. My solution? I rebooted. Everything worked fine after that. It was silent once more. It turned out he had the computer in sleep mode for over half a year ‚Äî since his last visit he had never rebooted. A system reboot at least once a month is a good way to clear out any weird or corrupt processes that may be running.\n\n<em><strong>*</strong>(stay tuned for a future post on why I bought OmniWeb for my father-in-law)</em>\n<h3>2. Don't be afraid to customize</h3>\nI've found that many Mac users never change anything when it comes to their Mac's appearance or layout. My opinion? Have fun with it. Make your Mac fit your lifestyle and workflow. Add apps to your Dock, drag Apps you don't use off your Dock, add Finder shortcuts, change your Desktop picture...trust me, you can tweak just about everything and anything in the Mac OS.\n\nHow far you take it depends on how adventurous you are, but even the most conservative of users should try out a bit of customization. It's your Mac, after all.\n\nHere's one small <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/355609/customize-your-macs-logon-screen\">example</a>. Here's <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/pro/tips/customize_toolbar.html\">another</a>. Here's yet <a href=\"http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20071115133729552\">another</a>. A good starting point to see how fun and\nuseful this can be is the free <a href=\"http://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html\">Tinkertool</a> from Marcel Bresink. The list is endless - explore forums, Mac sites, etc. and enjoy. Be careful though. It can be addicting.\n<h3>1. Set up your Mac with security in mind.</h3>\nSo, you pull your new Mac out of the box, plug it in and start using it within a few minutes. You're excited. You want to start having fun. Before you jump in, consider your <a href=\"http://leopardtips.blogspot.com/2007/11/all-about-user-accounts.html\">account structure</a>. One potential problem of the Mac OS is that the first account you create on your new Mac is always an <strong>administrator</strong> account. You won't have a choice here. The problem is that many new users don't know that it's not a good practice to use an Admin account for day-to-day use. So here's what you do: immediately create a new user account in '<strong>System Preferences</strong>' with full Admin privileges. Then, log in with this account and go back to 'System Preferences' and change the first account you created to a 'Standard' account. Finally, log out of the Admin account and log in to the first account.\n\nThis first account is the one to use on a daily basis. With your <strong>Standard</strong> account, you will be prompted to enter your Admin account name and password every time you install new software, change system preferences, etc. It's a bit of a pain, but it's a lot more secure. For Leopard users, be sure to check out the '<strong>Sharing Only</strong>' account (great choice when you have relatives visiting who want to use your Mac) and '<strong>Managed with Parental Controls</strong>' (great choice, of course, for kids). Oh, and make a note to ensure that your Mac Firewall is turned on (<em>System Preferences &gt; Security &gt; Firewall</em>)...inexplicably, the Firewall is turned off by default for users who upgrade from Tiger to Leopard.\n\nAnd what if you forget your Admin password? Fortunately, there is an easy fix. All you need to do is stick your OS X installation disk in your CD/DVD drive, restart your computer, and hold down '<strong>C</strong>' key as it restarts (<strong> remember this with C = CD-ROM</strong>). You can let go of the 'C' when you hear your CD/DVD drive whir to life. In time, a window will appear that asks you to select a user language. Then, as the next window pops open, you'll notice that there are now some menu options up in the <strong>Apple menu ba</strong>r (top of the screen). Choose '<strong>Utilities</strong>' (if you are running 10.4 Tiger or 10.5 Leopard) or '<strong>Installer</strong>' (for earlier versions of the Mac OS). Then choose '<strong>Reset Password</strong>.' Follow the simple instructions to choose a new password for the account of your choice, then quit the installation process (from the 'Installer' menu in the Menu Bar) and restart your computer without holding down 'C.' That's it.\n\nWhile it's great that it's so easy to reset an admin password, it's also kind of scary. What it means is that anyone with an installation disc and access to your machine can quite easily reset your admin password and access your files. The moral: if you have data that you don't want anyone to see under any circumstances, you will want to explore ways to encrypt this data and <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/42928/2005/02/8macsecuritytips.html\">protect your mac</a>. The other important point to make here: ensure you have a <a href=\"/2007/11/10/a-layered-backup-scheme/\">backup</a> before doing this, just in case.\n\nThat's it for now. Have a tip to share?\n",

				"content_text": "If the skies are clear where you live tomorrow night (or tonight, depending on your time zone), don't miss your chance to witness the last <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/eclipse_preview_080219.html\">lunar eclipse</a> until Dec. 2010.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.stellarium.org\"><img src=\"http://troykitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/lunar-eclipse.jpg\" alt=\"lunar-eclipse\" width=\"510\" height=\"393\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-456\" /></a>\n\nHere in Hawaii, I'll be heading out to the beach around 11 p.m. While I won't be bringing my Mac with me, this event marks a great occasion to highlight a few of the astronomy programs available for OS X. These tools are excellent teaching aids and are just plain enjoyable. If you don't have a Mac, no worries: each of these apps run on Mac, Windows, and Linux.\n\nIf you go outside to watch for the eclipse, keep an eye out for <a href=\"http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html\">Saturn</a> (<em>if you have a telescope the rings will be visible</em>) and <a href=\"http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/mm_regulus_star_050131.html\">Regulus</a> (<em>the 22nd brightest star in the night sky, in the Leo constellation</em>).\n\nSaturn and Regulus will be the brightest points in the sky nearest to the eclipsed moon. Exactly where they will appear relative to you, of course, will depend on your location and the time you go outside to have a look ‚Äî but they will appear to be close to the moon.\n<h3>Cloudy out? View the solar system on your Mac</h3>\n1. <a href=\"http://www.stellarium.org/\">Stellarium</a> ‚Äî <strong>Free</strong>. This planetarium application specializes on views of the sky from an earthly perspective. Enter your coordinates to see what's going on in your sky on a given night. This is my app of choice for casual desktop sky-gazing; it's also a great learning aid. I enjoy setting the program to fast-forward so I can watch the sky come to life in quicktime. There are many user-contributed scripts <a href=\"http://www.stellarium.org/wiki/index.php/Scripts\">available</a> to enhance your Stellarium experience which make an already interesting program even more engaging. This is a great program to keep on your Mac for those times when you want to quickly identify a star or constellation.\n\n2. <a href=\"http://earth.google.com/\">Google Earth</a> ‚Äî <strong>Free</strong>. It isn't just for earth-browsing any more. Check out the 'Sky' view mode for a full-featured astronomy package chock full of user-contributed goodness. I've lost many hours engrossed in the 'Sky' view; this Google Earth expansion is still a pretty new feature, but it keeps getting better and better.\n\n3. <a href=\"http://www.shatters.net/celestia/\">Celestia</a> ‚Äî <strong>Free</strong>. Celestia doesn't confine you to viewing stars from an earth-bound perspective. You are free to fly around the visible universe in dizzying three dimensions. There are many, many <a href=\"http://www.celestiamotherlode.net/\">expansions</a> available for Celestia that make it even more fun and valuable as a learning tool. The one thing about Celestia is that it's not quite as easy to use as the other programs; still, it's an amazing tool with a dedicated user base and it's a joy to use.\n\n4. <a href=\"http://www.starrynightstore.com/stniso.html\">Starry Night</a> ‚Äî <strong>Expensive</strong>. I own an old Mac OS 9 version of Starry Night Pro and I still use it on my old iBook G4 in <em>Classic</em> mode (note that <em>Classic</em> only runs on Tiger and earlier versions of Mac OS X). It's come a long way since then and is worth checking out if you really enjoy astronomy and want a feature-rich package with many great animations and photo-realistic imagery. Even the old version of Starry Night that I own is visually very beautiful. It's a great teaching aid to view the solar system in motion from any perspective, watch eclipses, find satellites, view the earth from distant planets, and more. If you go for the Pro package, you can hook up your Mac to your telescope to track distant objects. My only problem with Starry Night is that it seems to have gone overboard a bit with commercialization ‚Äî there are now at least six SN packages to choose from, and all of them are pricey.\n\nMy favorite experience with Starry Night? Heading out in a canoe late at night with my old iBook back in my home state of Maine on <a href=\"http://www.nicatous.com/index.html\">Nicatous Lake</a> (far, far away from any light pollution), turning on Starry Night's 'night vision mode' and spending a few hours looking up at the sky. Note that this is only enjoyable in the summer while doused with about one gallon of bug spray to keep the mosquitos away.\n<h3>More Mac astronomy links</h3>\nIf Mac astronomy software interests you, check out Pure Mac's <a href=\"http://www.pure-mac.com/astronomy.html\">comprehensive list of astronomy apps</a> for more ideas. Hope the skies are clear wherever you may live.\n",

For me and my wife, life is just easier using one account, despite our different organizational styles. I'd venture to guess that no one would really recommend this set up, but it's good for us. Here are a few of the ways we make it work. Even if you don't share an account, this list may provide you with some fresh ideas.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>1. Admin or Standard account?</h3>\nWe set up our shared account up with 'Standard' user privileges and then created a separate Admin account. This is a <a href=\"http://www.macusersforum.com/index.php?showtopic=16966&amp;mode=threaded&amp;pid=116756\">good practice</a>, even if you don't share an account. If you want to learn more about user accounts, check out this <a href=\"http://emperor.tidbits.com/webx/TakeControl/leopard-users.html\">affordable E-book from TidBITS</a>.\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>2. IC-Switch and DeliBar</h3>\nWe prefer to use different browsers and news readers, so we use <a href=\"http://flip.macrobyte.net/software/ic-switch_en\">IC-Switch</a>. This free little Menu Bar application allows us to quickly toggle between default internet applications. I also use a Menu Bar application called <a href=\"http://www.shinyfrog.net/it/software/delibar/\">DeliBar</a> that allows me to view my stored online bookmarks (via my <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/\">del.icio.us</a> account) right in my Menu Bar. I like managing and storing my bookmarks online because it enables me to access my favorites in any browser, and in any location. If you like Menu Bar items, by the way, check out <a href=\"http://menu.jeweledplatypus.org/\">this list</a>.\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>3. Documents folder</h3>\nWe created three main subfolders within our Documents folder: one for me, one for my wife, and one for shared items such as our finances. We did the same for our Pictures folder (for those images that we do not want to manage from within iPhoto). We use color labels to easily identify our folders at a glance e‚Äî my folders are labeled with red, my wife's are purple, and folders with shared documents are gray.\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>4. Alternate keyboard languages</h3>\nThings are a bit more complicated for us because I use the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard\">Dvorak</a> keyboard layout and my wife uses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY\">Qwerty</a>. Solution? We set up our Mac with both languages via the 'International' system preference (System Preferences &gt; International &gt; Input Menu). We then checked the option to 'Show the Input Menu in menu bar' so we have a nice visual way to see what language is currently active. Finally, we established a key combination to quickly toggle between the two input languages (this option is also available in the Input Menu).\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>5. The Dock</h3>\nI don't really use the Dock, but my wife does. She also uses Spotlight, and I never do. I use <a href=\"http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html\">Launchbar</a> to launch applications and navigate around the Mac (a free alternative is <a href=\"http://www.blacktree.com/\">QuickSilver</a>); <a href=\"http://www.dragthing.com/\">DragThing</a> is my preferred 'Dock replacement.'\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>6. Finder</h3>\nMy wife uses Finder and I use <a href=\"http://www.cocoatech.com/\">PathFinder</a>. This works out well ‚Äî she can set up Finder just how she likes it and I can set up PathFinder with my personal preferences. If you've never tried PathFinder, by the way, give it a spin. I couldn't live without it. Some people say, though, that it has too many features and options.\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>7. Web browsing</h3>\nI use <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/\">Firefox</a> when I'm doing webwork and <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/\">OmniWeb</a> when I'm just having fun. My wife prefers Safari.\n\nThat's about it. One final note: I recently downloaded the trial for a program called <a href=\"http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php\">Hazel</a> from NoodleSoft. This little program automates file organization, manages trash, monitors and organizes folders, and more. It's very clever and quite easy to use. I think this may be a great new tool to help me and my wife manage our shared account.\n",

Version 2.0 of Inbox is now in the works.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Since the program is well-designed, ties in nicely with other apps (in particular, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->QuickSilver<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and is free, it will likely continue to have a strong following. If you&rsquo;re one of those power users who like lots of options and choices, you may love this. Others may find the user interface a bit cluttered and overwhelming. One thing you will like: many users note that the developer is very responsive and the app is frequently updated. Version 2.0 (an Alpha release) of iGTD is now available for preview.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The user interface is genius: it&rsquo;s clean and sleek ‚Äî but there is a lot under the hood here once you get comfortable with the workflow. I&rsquo;ve found OmniGroup customer support to be top-notch: quick, responsive, and helpful.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>If you like the idea of creating your own workflow and don&rsquo;t have a problem with putting in some time to set up a tagging structure that works for you, you may love it. It&rsquo;s still early in the game (as it hasn&rsquo;t even bee\nn released yet) but the Beta is great. I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of positive user comments out in the macosphere ‚Äî and people seem to be genuinely excited about using this app. The trial is available now. Check out the developer&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wiki<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for tutorials and inspiration.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>With this in mind, I think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cultured Code Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> stands out as the best bet.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniFocus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a close second and will likely be the app of choice for many business users who have tons of tasks to manage (the higher price of OmniFocus will continue to be a limiting factor). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Midnight Inbox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iGTD<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will surely continue to build upon a stable cadre of dedicated users, but I don&rsquo;t think they will be the breakaway apps that bring sophisticated GTD-based task management to the masses. They are great, but they may be just a little too geeky for some.</p>\n<p>I should note, in closing, that this site and these reviews are not sponsored by anybody. I should also add that I am by no means a GTD expert, and that all the reviews here are just my opinions. I really believe that all four of these applications are excellent, well-designed and full of promise.

Version 2.0 of Inbox is now in the works.\n<h4>Pro:</h4>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">beautiful to look at; nice design; novel auto-collecting of data; system-wide quick entry</span>\n<h4>Con:</h4>\ncomplicated; a little buggy; data entry options are limited and unconventional; workflow can feel restrictive; iTunes metaphor is a little weird</fieldset>\n<fieldset>\n<h4>3. bartek:bargiel's iGTD | <a href=\"http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/\">Developer's site</a> | <a href=\"/2008/01/11/gtd-based-task-management-apps-part-two/\">full review</a></h4>\n<h4>Summary:</h4>\niGTD is powerful, full-featured, and free. This program follows the concepts and ideas of GTD quite closely ‚Äî second only to Midnight Inbox. It's been around longer than most of the others, so the feature-set is quite mature.\n\nSince the program is well-designed, ties in nicely with other apps (in particular, <a href=\"http://www.blacktree.com/\">QuickSilver</a>) and is free, it will likely continue to have a strong following. If you're one of those power users who like lots of options and choices, you may love this. Others may find the user interface a bit cluttered and overwhelming. One thing you will like: many users note that the developer is very responsive and the app is frequently updated. Version 2.0 (an Alpha release) of iGTD is now available for preview.\n<h4>Pro:</h4>\nfree; great Mac OS and third-party application integration; nice design; chock full of features; system-wide quick entry\n<h4>Con:</h4>\ncomplicated; some may find the array of options and choices daunting; some terminology is confusing and hard to differentiate (especially if you aren't very familiar with GTD)</fieldset>\n<fieldset>\n<h4>2. OmniGroup's OmniFocus | <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/\">Developer's site</a> | <a href=\"/2008/01/20/task-management-apps-part-three/\">full review</a></h4>\n<h4>Summary:</h4>\nOmniFocus is a powerful task management application with advanced sorting and viewing options that exceed what you'll find in the others. It is obvious from the start that some serious brain power went into designing this software. You may be overwhelmed by the sheer variety of ways you can organize your data, but many users really like it. Perhaps more than the others, this app maintains a relatively uncluttered feel even if you're managing tons of tasks.\n\nThe user interface is genius: it's clean and sleek ‚Äî but there is a lot under the hood here once you get comfortable with the workflow. I've found OmniGroup customer support to be top-notch: quick, responsive, and helpful.\n<h4>Pro:</h4>\nnovel 'perspectives' feature is a handy way to 'memorize' favorite views; very well-thought out design; may have the best 'scalability' of the bunch; easy to zoom in to a project or task, then zoom back out for a global view; developer has great track record for quality, support; system-wide quick entry\n<h4>Con:</h4>\nThe most expensive of the bunch; you may get bogged down by all the sorting, viewing and tagging options; relatively steep learning curve</fieldset>\n<fieldset>\n<h4>1. Cultured Code's Things | <a href=\"http://www.culturedcode.com/things/\">Developer's site</a> | <a href=\"/2008/02/04/gtd-based-task-management-apps-v-things/\">full review</a></h4>\n<h4>Summary:</h4>\nThings is clean, mean, and lean. It's the least 'GTD-like' of the bunch, so if you want a pure GTD-based workflow you may not like this app. The developers came up with some really interesting ideas with this one; most notably they integrated user-defined tags to organize and view data in a variety of ways.\n\nIf you like the idea of creating your own workflow and don't have a problem with putting in some time to set up a tagging structure that works for you, you may love it. It's still early in the game (as it hasn't even bee\nn released yet) but the Beta is great. I've been reading a lot of positive user comments out in the macosphere ‚Äî and people seem to be genuinely excited about using this app. The trial is available now. Check out the developer's <a href=\"http://culturedcode.com/things/wiki/index.php?title=Welcome\">wiki</a> for tutorials and inspiration.\n<h4>Pro:</h4>\nBeautiful user interface; it has a certain Zen quality of simplicity to it; don't need to know any GTD to quickly understand and start using it; system-wide quick entry\n<h4>Con:</h4>\nMany features are still missing; the app interface can start to feel cluttered if you have too many tags/tasks; minimal ways to enter new data</fieldset>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\nAs I noted in my initial <a href=\"/2008/01/03/2008-the-year-of-the-killer-task-management-app/\">post</a> in this series, I think the program that will rise to the top of the pack in popularity will be the one that does not require the user to know anything at all about GTD, is easy (dare I say <em>fun</em>) to use, and best captures that elusive 'Mac-like' quality of simplicity and elegance.\n\nWith this in mind, I think <a href=\"http://www.culturedcode.com/things/\">Cultured Code Things</a> stands out as the best bet.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/\">OmniFocus</a> is a close second and will likely be the app of choice for many business users who have tons of tasks to manage (the higher price of OmniFocus will continue to be a limiting factor). <a href=\"http://www.midnightbeep.com/\">Midnight Inbox</a> and <a href=\"http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/\">iGTD</a> will surely continue to build upon a stable cadre of dedicated users, but I don't think they will be the breakaway apps that bring sophisticated GTD-based task management to the masses. They are great, but they may be just a little too geeky for some.\n\nI should note, in closing, that this site and these reviews are not sponsored by anybody. I should also add that I am by no means a GTD expert, and that all the reviews here are just my opinions. I really believe that all four of these applications are excellent, well-designed and full of promise. I urge you to try each one out to decide for yourself, and I hope this series will help you get started.

				"title": "GTD-based Task Management Apps V: Things",
				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->NOTE: (Summer 2010) When I get the time, I may review Things again. This article is quite out of date, but there are still some useful bits in it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is the fifth post in a series comparing <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->task management applications<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> based on the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Things Done<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; process. Today I&rsquo;ll look at Cultured Code&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>For an application that hasn&rsquo;t yet been released, Cultured Code&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is generating a healthy amount of discussion in the Mac community. Why? It&rsquo;s arguably the easiest to use of any of the Mac-based GTD task management systems, it&rsquo;s elegant and the interface is beautiful. It&rsquo;s also the application that is the most loosely-based on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Things Done<!-- raw HTML omitted --> framework.</p>\n<p>This all adds up to an application that effectively lowers the entry barrier for those who are interested in exploring the &lsquo;Getting Things Done&rsquo; process, but have been scared away by complex user interfaces or steep learning curves posed by other applications in this field. Things, in other words, conforms to the basic ideas of GTD, but it&rsquo;s flexible enough to allow you to come up with your own unique management system. It&rsquo;s GTD light.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things' is in the Beta stage now ‚Äî anyone can go and download a free trial that will remain operable until version 1.0 is released this Spring. The current version is at 0.9.6 at the time of this post. You should be aware that the interface and features of the current version are due to change; &lsquo;due to improve&rsquo; would be more accurate.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> While I didn&rsquo;t find too many holes in this pre-release version (and it has been perfectly stable on my installation of OS X Leopard), there are a few features that I&rsquo;d like to see added which I&rsquo;ll highlight at the end of the article. Fortunately, the developers are still adding features and refining the user interface based on user feedback and their own ideas.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Obviously, &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Collect<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; is where you collect things. Like the other GTD-based apps we&rsquo;ve looked at, the collection starting point is the &lsquo;Inbox.&rsquo; This is GTD straight from the tap: the Inbox is where you collect tasks as they pop into your head ‚Äî where you dump all those nagging things floating around in your brain into a trusted system. Once these items are captured, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about forgetting them anymore. Easy enough.</p>\n<p>¬†\nWith the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Focus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> section, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> starts to diverge from the other GTD programs we&rsquo;ve reviewed. Think of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Focus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> section as place to view your tasks oriented by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->time<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You can view things you have to do <!-- raw HTML omitted -->today<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, you can see all the stuff that&rsquo;s due &lsquo;other than today&rsquo; (which is labeled &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; in Things), you can see the stuff you&rsquo;ve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->postponed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to a later date, and you can view things you may want to do <!-- raw HTML omitted -->someday<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (with no set time or date).</p>\n<p>While <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iGTD<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniFocus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Midnight Inbox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> all offer ways to organize and view tasks using similar terminology and concepts, they tend to emphasize contexts and projects over time/date based views. It&rsquo;s a subtle difference, but it&rsquo;s worth noting.</p>\n<p>Within this &lsquo;Focus&rsquo; section, you will likely spend most of your time in the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; view; this is where you get a snapshot of all the tasks you&rsquo;ve accumulated ‚Äî organized by project and area first, then by date/time within these areas. The &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; view, by the way, reminds me of the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Review<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; category (or sorting option) of the other GTD-based apps. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> does not directly employ the GTD &lsquo;review&rsquo; concept (which emphasizes the value of periodically validating your tasks to ensure you remain on track and on target).</p>\n<p>If you want to review your tasks in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, you won&rsquo;t find a specific workflow designed to help you do this. If I understand this correctly, the developers at Cultured Code expect you to use the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; Focus (where you see all of your tasks in one main window) as your go-to place to track and review your tasks on an ongoing basis. Again, it&rsquo;s subtle but significantly different than the others. You can review your items if you want to. If you don&rsquo;t want to, no problem.</p>\n<p>Next is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Organize<!-- raw HTML omitted --> section. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> allows you to organize by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Project<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Area<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Project will be immediately obvious to most people and is a core part of the GTD process: a project is a container for a list of tasks that must be completed in order to reach a goal (and the goal here is the name of the Project). For instance, I have a project labeled &lsquo;Sell Honda,&rsquo; and each of the tasks in this project, once completed, will hopefully result in the selling of the Honda. Once the project is done, it&rsquo;s closed out. It&rsquo;s then moved to the &lsquo;Log&rsquo; section of the program, which is called the &lsquo;Archive&rsquo; in other apps. Easy. This isn&rsquo;t really any different than the others.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p>But what about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Area<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? This one is less obvious, and it&rsquo;s not a GTD term as far as I know (but it&rsquo;s an interesting derivative). Think of an area as a project without an end point. I have created &lsquo;Mac maintenance,&rsquo; &lsquo;Home maintenance,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Health &amp; Wellness&rsquo; entries as my Areas of responsibility. For these categories, there is no real &lsquo;completion&rsquo; of a project or end state. I&rsquo;m going to need to manage and complete tasks that fall into these broad categories perpetually (many will be repeating tasks), but the area of interest will always remain relevant and viable. It&rsquo;s an idea that is unique to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ‚Äî you won&rsquo;t find a similar function in any of the other GTD-based apps.</p>\n<p>The main problem (which I quickly discovered using Area of Responsibility function) is that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> offers no solution to schedule repeating tasks, which is something I need to do. For Mac maintenance, for instance, I want to run maintenance scripts using Titanium Software&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Onyx<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on a repeating schedule. However &hellip; I&rsquo;m not too worried about this. This feature will soon be added according to a <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Feb. 4 post on the Cultured Code blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. For now, I&rsquo;m forced to manually re-enter my repeating tasks. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->UPDATE: As of Beta 0.9, Things now supports recurring tasks<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>¬†\nI forgot to mention one important item: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> also lets you assign tasks to other people. In the screenshot, I&rsquo;ve assigned &lsquo;cleaning the garage&rsquo; to a fictitious person named Saiki. This could be very handy if you are using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to manage a larger project with multiple people, or if you manage several people and want to assign and track tasks for them. For now, it appears that this collaboration tool is still limited to local (non-networked) use only. In the future, Cultured Code plans to add a collaboration across the network to manage multi-user tasking with, presumably, other people that are also using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;ll be curious to see how this will be implemented.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In the case of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, tagging can be used to &lsquo;tag&rsquo; how much time you think each task will take, to indicate the type of task, to mark the amount of effort you intend to put into a certain task, to add contexts, etc. It&rsquo;s an open-ended system, and it&rsquo;s entirely up to you to decide how your tasks will be tagged. So, while it appears that contexts were axed in this app, they are really still there &hellip; but only if you choose to add them.</p>\n<p>As an example, you can see (in screenshot #5) that I&rsquo;ve added an &lsquo;@&rsquo; tag category with sub-tags for &lsquo;mac,&rsquo; and &lsquo;home&rsquo; (I&rsquo;ve also added a tag for &lsquo;errands&rsquo; which you can&rsquo;t see in the screencast - this is an example of how the tags only appear if they are used. In this example, I&rsquo;ve not yet used the &lsquo;errand&rsquo; tag &hellip; so it doesn&rsquo;t appear). This is an example of the GTD idea of &lsquo;contexts.&rsquo; My context tags are markers I use to filter through all my tasks when I want to see what I have to do based on my current location (at my mac, out running errands, or at home, for instance). Other GTD-based apps also give the user the ability to add user-defined contexts, but Things is the only app that combines contexts together with all the other &lsquo;markers&rsquo; you choose to assign to your tasks.</p>\n<p>To see what I mean, take a look at the screenshot here. Note that I&rsquo;ve added a bunch of other tags (in addition to contexts) to help further refine the filtering of my tasks. This is freeform to the extreme: the system you devise can be as complex or as simple as you like. To see how tags can help you filter your tasks, we&rsquo;ll next look at how it all fits together.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Over time, my tag list has stabilized ‚Äî I found it worked best for me to keep the tag list short and manageable. If I didn&rsquo;t do this, I think the filtering power of the tags would be greatly watered down. Next I file my tasks by dragging and dropping them to the appropriate Project or Area (which are also user-created). I can also choose to add tasks to &lsquo;Someday&rsquo; if I want to come back to the task at some undefined future time; or &lsquo;Postponed&rsquo; if I want to keep the task in a &lsquo;hold&rsquo; status until a future date of my choosing. I can also move an item from a project or area to the postponed or someday category, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> provides me a useful little unobtrusive reminder that I have an item in these categories ‚Äî but the items remain hidden from view unless I want to see them (you can see an example of this in screenshot #3 - look for the line that says &lsquo;1 more someday or postponed&hellip;').</p>\n<p>Then I start completing my tasks, selecting items by viewing them in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Focus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> area of the program. Within the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Focus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> section, I may choose &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Today<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; to view what&rsquo;s due to today, &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; to see everything else that&rsquo;s coming up, etc.</p>\n<p>But what about the tags? This is the best part of the program in my opinion. Tags appear horizontally across the top of the main program window (again, see screenshot #5). Only tags that are relevant for the given tasks that you&rsquo;re viewing are displayed. To filter tasks using tags, simply click on a tag. To filter tasks by more than one tag, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shift-click<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to select more than one tag. By way of example, say I want to see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->personal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tasks that are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->high<!-- raw HTML omitted --> priority, and can only be done on my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Since I&rsquo;ve already tagged my tasks with certain keywords, I simply select the tags that apply (in this case, &lsquo;personal,&rsquo; &lsquo;Mac,&rsquo; and &lsquo;high&rsquo;). It&rsquo;s a simple and powerful solution. I think tagging offers an easier way to filter tasks than the other GTD-based apps. But there is a catch: with so much flexibility comes responsibility. You have to be willing to put in time and effort to create a system that works for you. Things provides a starting point for you (suggested tags), but it&rsquo;s up to you to make your tags meaningful.</p>\n<p>After using the app for a while, I started to develop a tagging system that really worked for me. In my case, I discovered that &lsquo;more was less:&rsquo; I found a sweet spot between too many tags (which can be confusing) and too few (which won&rsquo;t help you sort through your tasks very well). I really like the idea of establishing my own filtering system. If you use tagging in other programs (I rely on it with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yojimbo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), the Things methodology should not be very foreign to you.</p>\n<p>¬†\nThe last function I should note is the system-wide shortcut that allows you to quickly enter new tasks regardless of what application you are currently using (note that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> must be open for this to work). It&rsquo;s a user-defined shortcut ‚Äî in my case I use Shift-Control-Space, but you can assign any shortcut combo you like. This is by far the easiest way to enter new data ‚Äî mainly because you can invoke the shortcut anywhere, and the pop-up window allows you to choose where you want your task to go (which Focus or Organization category). This feature (the ability to easily choose where your task should be filed) is curiously missing when you enter a new task from within the program (there are other options from within the program, but they are not as easy as the quick entry).</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>There were three items that required me to do a little more reading to fully grasp: first, I was not sure what to make of the term &lsquo;Areas of Responsibility&rsquo; until I read the developer&rsquo;s explanation.

				"content_text": "<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; font-style: italic; line-height: 1;\">NOTE: (Summer 2010) When I get the time, I may review Things again. This article is quite out of date, but there are still some useful bits in it.</span>\n\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">This is the fifth post in a series comparing </span><a style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\" href=\"/2008/01/03/2008-the-year-of-the-killer-task-management-app/\">task management applications</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\"> based on the '</span><a style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\" href=\"http://www.davidco.com/\">Getting Things Done</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">' process. Today I'll look at Cultured Code's </span><em style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">Things</em><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">.</span>\n\nFor an application that hasn't yet been released, Cultured Code's <em>Things</em> is generating a healthy amount of discussion in the Mac community. Why? It's arguably the easiest to use of any of the Mac-based GTD task management systems, it's elegant and the interface is beautiful. It's also the application that is the most loosely-based on the <strong>Getting Things Done</strong> framework.\n\nThis all adds up to an application that effectively lowers the entry barrier for those who are interested in exploring the 'Getting Things Done' process, but have been scared away by complex user interfaces or steep learning curves posed by other applications in this field. Things, in other words, conforms to the basic ideas of GTD, but it's flexible enough to allow you to come up with your own unique management system. It's GTD light.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Things' is in the Beta stage now ‚Äî anyone can go and download a free trial that will remain operable until version 1.0 is released this Spring. The current version is at 0.9.6 at the time of this post. You should be aware that the interface and features of the current version are due to change; 'due to improve' would be more accurate.</span> While I didn't find too many holes in this pre-release version (and it has been perfectly stable on my installation of OS X Leopard), there are a few features that I'd like to see added which I'll highlight at the end of the article. Fortunately, the developers are still adding features and refining the user interface based on user feedback and their own ideas.\n<h3>Collect - Focus - Organize</h3>\nLet's start with an overview. The app breaks down task management into three main action verbs: <strong>Collect</strong>, <strong>Focus</strong>, and <strong>Organize</strong>. Each concept is easy to understand. Unlike other GTD-based programs in this category, Things does not offer a heap of sub-choices, organization and filtering options. Instead, the developers place this burden on the user through the use of <em>tags</em>. This freeform tagging system allows each user to effectively create a (very simple or very complex) filtering system based on individual choice. I'll get to tags in a moment, but let's first walk through each of the three main categories of task organization.\n\nObviously, '<strong>Collect</strong>' is where you collect things. Like the other GTD-based apps we've looked at, the collection starting point is the 'Inbox.' This is GTD straight from the tap: the Inbox is where you collect tasks as they pop into your head ‚Äî where you dump all those nagging things floating around in your brain into a trusted system. Once these items are captured, you don't have to worry about forgetting them anymore. Easy enough.\n\n&nbsp;\nWith the <strong>Focus</strong> section, <em>Things</em> starts to diverge from the other GTD programs we've reviewed. Think of the <strong>Focus</strong> section as place to view your tasks oriented by <em>time</em>. You can view things you have to do <em>today</em>, you can see all the stuff that's due 'other than today' (which is labeled '<em>Next</em>' in Things), you can see the stuff you've <em>postponed</em> to a later date, and you can view things you may want to do <em>someday</em> (with no set time or date).\n\nWhile <a href=\"http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/\">iGTD</a>, <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/\">OmniFocus</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.midnightbeep.com/\">Midnight Inbox</a> all offer ways to organize and view tasks using similar terminology and concepts, they tend to emphasize contexts and projects over time/date based views. It's a subtle difference, but it's worth noting.\n\nWithin this 'Focus' section, you will likely spend most of your time in the '<em>Next</em>' view; this is where you get a snapshot of all the tasks you've accumulated ‚Äî organized by project and area first, then by date/time within these areas. The '<strong>Next</strong>' view, by the way, reminds me of the '<strong>Review</strong>' category (or sorting option) of the other GTD-based apps. <em>Things</em> does not directly employ the GTD 'review' concept (which emphasizes the value of periodically validating your tasks to ensure you remain on track and on target).\n\nIf you want to review your tasks in <em>Things</em>, you won't find a specific workflow designed to help you do this. If I understand this correctly, the developers at Cultured Code expect you to use the '<em>Next</em>' Focus (where you see all of your tasks in one main window) as your go-to place to track and review your tasks on an ongoing basis. Again, it's subtle but significantly different than the others. You can review your items if you want to. If you don't want to, no problem.\n\nNext is the <strong>Organize</strong> section. <em>Things</em> allows you to organize by <strong>Project</strong> and by <strong>Area</strong>. Project will be immediately obvious to most people and is a core part of the GTD process: a project is a container for a list of tasks that must be completed in order to reach a goal (and the goal here is the name of the Project). For instance, I have a project labeled 'Sell Honda,' and each of the tasks in this project, once completed, will hopefully result in the selling of the Honda. Once the project is done, it's closed out. It's then moved to the 'Log' section of the program, which is called the 'Archive' in other apps. Easy. This isn't really any different than the others.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut what about <strong>Area</strong>? This one is less obvious, and it's not a GTD term as far as I know (but it's an interesting derivative). Think of an area as a project without an end point. I have created 'Mac maintenance,' 'Home maintenance,' and 'Health &amp; Wellness' entries as my Areas of responsibility. For these categories, there is no real 'completion' of a project or end state. I'm going to need to manage and complete tasks that fall into these broad categories perpetually (many will be repeating tasks), but the area of interest will always remain relevant and viable. It's an idea that is unique to <em>Things</em> ‚Äî you won't find a similar function in any of the other GTD-based apps.\n\nThe main problem (which I quickly discovered using Area of Responsibility function) is that <em>Things</em> offers no solution to schedule repeating tasks, which is something I need to do. For Mac maintenance, for instance, I want to run maintenance scripts using Titanium Software's <a href=\"http://www.titanium.free.fr/pgs2/english/download.html\">Onyx</a> on a repeating schedule. However ... I'm not too worried about this. This feature will soon be added according to a <a href=\"http://culturedcode.com/things/blog/2008/02/habemus-dialogum-we-ha%20ve-a-dialog.html\"> Feb. 4 post on the Cultured Code blog</a>. For now, I'm forced to manually re-enter my repeating tasks. <em>UPDATE: As of Beta 0.9, Things now supports recurring tasks</em>\n\n&nbsp;\nI forgot to mention one important item: <em>Things</em> also lets you assign tasks to other people. In the screenshot, I've assigned 'cleaning the garage' to a fictitious person named Saiki. This could be very handy if you are using <em>Things</em> to manage a larger project with multiple people, or if you manage several people and want to assign and track tasks for them. For now, it appears that this collaboration tool is still limited to local (non-networked) use only. In the future, Cultured Code plans to add a collaboration across the network to manage multi-user tasking with, presumably, other people that are also using <em>Things</em>. I'll be curious to see how this will be implemented.\n<h3>Where are the Contexts?</h3>\nGTD adherents may wonder where the '<strong>Context</strong>' section has gone. The answer is that Things did away with contexts (<em>sort of</em>), choosing instead to give the user an entirely unique and freeform way to categorize data. Things uses tags. Tagging, in case you're not familiar with it, is a handy way used in many applications these days to add keywords to your data to help you quickly select a subset.\n\nIn the case of <em>Things</em>, tagging can be used to 'tag' how much time you think each task will take, to indicate the type of task, to mark the amount of effort you intend to put into a certain task, to add contexts, etc. It's an open-ended system, and it's entirely up to you to decide how your tasks will be tagged. So, while it appears that contexts were axed in this app, they are really still there ... but only if you choose to add them.\n\nAs an example, you can see (in screenshot #5) that I've added an '@' tag category with sub-tags for 'mac,' and 'home' (I've also added a tag for 'errands' which you can't see in the screencast - this is an example of how the tags only appear if they are used. In this example, I've not yet used the 'errand' tag ... so it doesn't appear). This is an example of the GTD idea of 'contexts.' My context tags are markers I use to filter through all my tasks when I want to see what I have to do based on my current location (at my mac, out running errands, or at home, for instance). Other GTD-based apps also give the user the ability to add user-defined contexts, but Things is the only app that combines contexts together with all the other 'markers' you choose to assign to your tasks.\n\nTo see what I mean, take a look at the screenshot here. Note that I've added a bunch of other tags (in addition to contexts) to help further refine the filtering of my tasks. This is freeform to the extreme: the system you devise can be as complex or as simple as you like. To see how tags can help you filter your tasks, we'll next look at how it all fits together.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>The Things workflow</h3>\nIt's much harder to describe the Things workflow than it is for the other GTD-based apps because the program doesn't really follow a defined process (in this respect, it's closest cousin is OmniFocus). Here's what I do. First, I enter a bunch of tasks in my inbox. Next, I create some projects and areas to contain those tasks. Following this, I comb through each task and assign tags.\n\nOver time, my tag list has stabilized ‚Äî I found it worked best for me to keep the tag list short and manageable. If I didn't do this, I think the filtering power of the tags would be greatly watered down. Next I file my tasks by dragging and dropping them to the appropriate Project or Area (which are also user-created). I can also choose to add tasks to 'Someday' if I want to come back to the task at some undefined future time; or 'Postponed' if I want to keep the task in a 'hold' status until a future date of my choosing. I can also move an item from a project or area to the postponed or someday category, and <em>Things</em> provides me a useful little unobtrusive reminder that I have an item in these categories ‚Äî but the items remain hidden from view unless I want to see them (you can see an example of this in screenshot #3 - look for the line that says '1 more someday or postponed...').\n\nThen I start completing my tasks, selecting items by viewing them in the <strong>Focus</strong> area of the program. Within the <strong>Focus</strong> section, I may choose '<strong>Today</strong>' to view what's due to today, '<strong>Next</strong>' to see everything else that's coming up, etc.\n\nBut what about the tags? This is the best part of the program in my opinion. Tags appear horizontally across the top of the main program window (again, see screenshot #5). Only tags that are relevant for the given tasks that you're viewing are displayed. To filter tasks using tags, simply click on a tag. To filter tasks by more than one tag, <em>Shift-click</em> to select more than one tag. By way of example, say I want to see <strong>personal</strong> tasks that are <strong>high</strong> priority, and can only be done on my <strong>Mac</strong>. Since I've already tagged my tasks with certain keywords, I simply select the tags that apply (in this case, 'personal,' 'Mac,' and 'high'). It's a simple and powerful solution. I think tagging offers an easier way to filter tasks than the other GTD-based apps. But there is a catch: with so much flexibility comes responsibility. You have to be willing to put in time and effort to create a system that works for you. Things provides a starting point for you (suggested tags), but it's up to you to make your tags meaningful.\n\nAfter using the app for a while, I started to develop a tagging system that really worked for me. In my case, I discovered that 'more was less:' I found a sweet spot between too many tags (which can be confusing) and too few (which won't help you sort through your tasks very well). I really like the idea of establishing my own filtering system. If you use tagging in other programs (I rely on it with <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/\">Yojimbo</a>), the Things methodology should not be very foreign to you.\n\n&nbsp;\nThe last function I should note is the system-wide shortcut that allows you to quickly enter new tasks regardless of what application you are currently using (note that <em>Things</em> must be open for this to work). It's a user-defined shortcut ‚Äî in my case I use Shift-Control-Space, but you can assign any shortcut combo you like. This is by far the easiest way to enter new data ‚Äî mainly because you can invoke the shortcut anywhere, and the pop-up window allows you to choose where you want your task to go (which Focus or Organization category). This feature (the ability to easily choose where your task should be filed) is curiously missing when you enter a new task from within the program (there are other options from within the program, but they are not as easy as the quick entry).\n<h3>The Verdict</h3>\n<h3><em>1. Could I figure out how to use the application with minimal fuss (preferably without referring to documentation)?</em></h3>\nYes, I was able to start using <em>Things</em> without reading any documentation. The developers of this program have clearly focused on simplicity and lack of clutter as a first priority. Using <em>Things</em> is pretty easy right from the start. Using it <em>well</em>, on the other hand, is another matter. As with any program that you intend to regularly use, it's worth the effort to read up on features and suggested usage. I'm sometimes lazy about reading documentation, but I invariably get a lot more out of a program if I take the time. <em>Things</em> is no exception. Check out Cultured Code's <a href=\"http://culturedcode.com/things/wiki/index.php?title=Welcome\">Wiki</a> for basic instructions and user-generated solutions. I think you'll find their documentation (though still a little sparse) to be well-written and fairly devoid of tech jargon. The first step you should take, though, is to watch the great <a href=\"http://culturedcode.com/things/screencast.html\">screencast</a> put together by Ian Beck from <a href=\"http://tagamac.com/\">Tagamac.com</a>. It covers the basic usage of the program very well.\n\nThere were three items that required me to do a little more reading to fully grasp: first, I was not sure what to make of the term 'Areas of Responsibility' until I read the developer's explanation. Second, while tagging was familiar to me, I felt that I needed some guidance to get some ideas about how to best set up my own tagging structure (the developer provides 'starter' tags, by the way, to help get you going). Third, I couldn't figure out where I was supposed to enter 'Contexts' for my tasks. After I read up on tagging, I figured that out.\n<h3><em>2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?</em></h3>\nYes. Of the applications I've tested, Things is my clear favorite. It's easy to use, it doesn't lock you into a set workflow, and it's not overburdened with choices and options. However, as I've said all along, this is more a matter of personal choice. I don't necessarily think <em>Things</em> is the best of the breed. I think <em>Things</em> is the best pick for a certain type of user. Those who adhere to and really understand GTD may find this application a little too light on GTD. I'll go into this in more detail in my final wrap-up post.\n<h3><em>3. How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?</em></h3>\nNot very well. There is, as of yet, very limited integration. However, the developer's are working on Mail, iCal, and other types of integration. Since the data you enter in <em>Things</em> is XML based, it really opens it up for sharing with other applications with relative ease. I'm eager to see how Cultured Code carries this forward. Other integration impressions: <em>Things</em> does have a services menu option. I like <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/SysServices/Concepts/menu.html\">Apple Services</a> ‚Äî this underused menu offers a way to add items to <em>Things</em> even if you haven't launched the program. Many programs integrate their apps with the Services menu ‚Äî not many Mac users use these services, though. Finally, as I mentioned before, you'll find no right-click menus anywhere. You will also not find a customized menu if you right-click on the program icon the Apple Dock. Many Mac users may not miss this at all. I do, but I admit this may be a latent hangover from my PC days (daze).\n<h3><em>4. How well could I manage all of my tasks (work, home, play, etc.)</em></h3>\nVery well. It's a very flexible program. While it appears to be very scalable (that is, the program can handle a few or many hundreds of tasks with relative ease), I think <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/\">OmniFocus</a> may have the edge when it comes to managing lots and lots of tasks. Why? Tags are nice, but aggregating all the sorting and filtering options within a tagging system has limitations in terms of '<em>viewability</em>.' I made that word up, but hopefully you know what I mean. I can see how my list of tasks might begin to be hard to filter/sort or hard to understand at a glance if I had hundreds of tasks with many tags. It could easily get unwieldy. Even with the few tags I'm using, some of my tasks have four or five tags. Imagine viewing a few dozen tasks within the <em>Things</em> '<strong>Next</strong>' view, each assigned four or five tags. I guess the developers are counting on users knowing what they're looking for. OmniFocus, on the other hands, includes pre-set filtering options all tucked away in a tidy little menu bar. As you add tasks with OmniFocus, you may find that it's easier to decipher because of the programs set (established) filtering options. This conclusion surprised me ‚Äî I went into my <em>Things</em> review thinking that OmniFocus offered too many viewing options. Now I see that <em>Things</em> can get very complicated if you use too many tags. I suppose the lesson here is to seriously think about your tagging structure!\n<h3><em>5. How did the program 'feel?' How 'Mac-like' is it?</em></h3>\nI think <em>Things</em> is the most Mac-like of all the apps I've looked at. It has a certain zen-like simplicity about it that really appeals to me. The user interface is clean and uncluttered, and the workflow is only as complex as I choose to make it. However, I wonder how well this will hold up as my task list continues to grow. I'm optimistic, but the vote is still out. In short, I think it it perfect for individual users who have a relatively finite number of tasks to manage. But I'm not so sure which application is the best of breed once applied to larger business workflows with multiple users and hundreds of tasks. I'll give this some more thought and post the results in the wrap-up.\n<h3><strong>In conclusion</strong>:</h3>\nThings will probably be a close competitor with OmniFocus. Both products offer a high degree of flexibility and scalability. Both have clean, well-thought out user interfaces. Midnight Inbox and iGTD, on the other hand, may appeal more to those who prefer a tighter GTD workflow with more visible options and a clearer workflow. I think that Things, however, offers the most flexibility of the bunch. And it offers this flexibility through an inspired user interface. I'll expand on these differences and summarize my final impressions of iGTD, OmniFocus, Midnight Inbox, and Things in the final post.\n\nBefore I go, I would like to point out a few annoyances I found with this program (with the hopes that most will be addressed before <em>Things</em> is released). Here's a rundown:\n- <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">You can't delete projects once you create them (as far as I can tell)</span> You can - see comments below.\n- Perhaps it's a remnant of my PC days, but I'm missing right-click options. There are none; nor is there a right-click menu from the Dock. Minor stuff, but it might broaden the appeal of the application\n- I would like to have the ability to <em>batch</em> add tags to tasks (select ten tasks, assign one new tag or change a tag for all ten at once)\n- In th\ne 'Next' view, I would like to see a clearer division between areas, projects, etc. (perhaps with the use of color-coding)\n- I would like to have the 'Where do you want to file this' option that is present in the quick task entry available when I enter a task from <em>within</em> the program. The 'File' button located on the bottom of the main window is clumsy. Dragging and dropping each item is inefficient\n- I would like an automated 'clean up' feature - like what is available in OmniFocus - to sort out my tasks with one click once I've assigned all the variables\n- the 'due today' and 'overdue' colors are the same shade of light red. I'd like them to be just slightly different so I can differentiate between them at a glance\n\n<a href=\"http://culturedcode.com/things/\"><em>Things</em></a> is available now as a preview release. This preview will remain fully functional until version 1.0 ships in the Spring. Once the program ships, a single user license will cost $49.

I was going to review <strong>CoalMarch Park</strong>, but it appears that it's no longer be offered by the company. Besides that, I think I've hit the four main contenders already with my reviews of OmniFocus, Things, Midnight Inbox, and iGTD.

				"content_html": "<p>This is the fourth post in a series comparing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->task management applications<!-- raw HTML omitted --> based on the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Things Done<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; process. Today I&rsquo;ll look at Midnight Beep Softworks' <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Midnight Inbox 1.2.8<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more than any other task management application I&rsquo;ve explored to date, Midnight Inbox from Midnight Beep strives to be the single point of entry ‚Äî the GTD command post ‚Äî through which you organize your life. Unique to the applications we&rsquo;ve looked at so far, this app is designed to reach out and grab data as it accumulates on your Mac through a clever use of Apple&rsquo;s Spotlight and smart folder technology (it doesn&rsquo;t actually move your data ‚Äî it just creates an alias).</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p>Out of the box, the app is configured to suck in emails from Apple Mail, files from your desktop, events and &lsquo;to dos&rsquo; from iCal, texts &amp; files from anywhere on your Mac, and shortcuts from Safari. As the program continually gathers all of this stuff together in one place, you periodically must process each item through a pre-defined Midnight Inbox workflow ‚Äî a workflow which is tightly based on the ideas and concepts of GTD.</p>\n<p>I had trouble getting used to this. Why would I want to automatically gather data from various locations on my Mac? That sounds like a lot of extra work.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I started to get it. Here&rsquo;s one way to look at it: Midnight Inbox is a Mac-based tool that implements the GTD workflow. It follows, then, that the &lsquo;Collection&rsquo; part of the program is designed to be the dumping grounds for everything in your brain. If your Mac is the epicenter of your busy life (your surrogate brain, in a sense), then Inbox intends to be the meta-filter, the super sorting and processing center, for your surrogate brain. In order to be that center, it needs to collect stuff from your surrogate brain. That makes sense, right?</p>\n<p>I think this metaphor holds up fairly well if your daily workflow centers around <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mail<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iCal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, text files, documents, and bookmarks. If you don&rsquo;t store your essential daily work within these programs or files in your work-a-day life, or if you prefer to manually add projects and items as you dream them up, you may find auto-collection a bit too time-intensive and restricting.</p>\n<p>I say &lsquo;time intensive&rsquo; because it can take considerable time and effort to process every item that Midnight Inbox sucks in (to be fair, you can adjust how much or little stuff the program draws in). I use &lsquo;restricting&rsquo; here in the sense that Inbox seems designed to function as an implementation of &lsquo;Getting Things Done&rsquo; first, and a general task manager second. That is, it&rsquo;s a program that focuses on implementing the GTD <!-- raw HTML omitted -->process<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I think it does an admirable job at this, but it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that this software implements a very specific workflow.</p>\n<p>Those of you who really groove on the GTD process and want a system that tightly follows this model may find this program particularly appealing. Other task management applications <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve looked at<!-- raw HTML omitted --> employ core GTD ideas in various ways, but they tend to offer higher levels of user-defined flexibility. That is, they focus more on providing a flexible framework, and it&rsquo;s up to you to manually enter actions and items ‚Äî and you can generally move stuff around in a more freeform fashion. Midnight Inbox, on the other hand is, at it&rsquo;s core, more about following a pre-defined task management process.</p>\n<p>Which way is better? Surely it will depend on the organizational style of the user. If you just finished reading David Allen&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->book<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, you may really take to this model. I personally prefer the applications that follow more freeform solutions.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p>The workflow is cleanly broken down into iconic sections, which are stacked in a left-hand column of the application&rsquo;s main window. The first item on this list is the &lsquo;Collect&rsquo; section, which I&rsquo;ve already talked a lot about in previous paragraphs. This is where your collected items gather.</p>\n<p>Next is the &lsquo;Process&rsquo; function. At a point of time of your choosing, you process through your collection of items. When you choose to &lsquo;Process Collections,&rsquo; a new dropdown menu pops up that presents you with options for filing each item that you collect.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p>From this menu, you may make a new project, complete an action immediately (if it&rsquo;s a task you can do in less than two minutes ‚Äî a GTD concept that is well integrated in this application), or file it away for the future. Curiously, you can&rsquo;t assign a context at this stage (keep reading if you&rsquo;re not sure what a context is). I like how Midnight Inbox handles processing: the dropdown menu is well-ordered, clear, and concise.</p>\n<p>Next, you move on to the &lsquo;Organize&rsquo; phase. As you might suspect, this is the stage at which you organize your stuff. Here, you may assign a context to an action, add new actions, add new projects, assign how often you&rsquo;d like to review a given project, etc. Midnight Beep describes the &lsquo;Organize&rsquo; phase as the &lsquo;heart of the Inbox experience.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s the place where, at a glance, you may view and reorganize all of the projects and associated actions you&rsquo;ve gathered. The organization phase focuses on refinement of your projects, categories, and contexts.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p>I should note that you can also choose to add new projects, actions, etc. on the fly here as the need arises (which is essential ‚Äî auto-collection is not likely to capture everything you need to act upon in your daily life. Clearly, though, the intent is that the auto-collection process will capture most of the important stuff).</p>\n<p>Next is &lsquo;Review,&rsquo; which will be familiar to those of you who know GTD. The basic idea is this: according to the GTD model, you should periodically review your open actions and projects to see if they are still correctly filed, within the correct context and project, etc. This is how you stay on track and keep all your actions in tidy order. This phase is fairly intuitive and similar to other GTD-based apps Ive looked at. Helpfully, the developer builds in pre-defined &lsquo;Reviews&rsquo; that you can select from a dropdown list while in the &lsquo;Organize&rsquo; phase. To initiate a review, you can either use an assigned shortcut key or choose a review option from the Menu Bar.</p>\n<p>Next on the list is the &lsquo;Work&rsquo; category. This is the phase where you may view your actions organized by context. &lsquo;Context&rsquo; is GTD parlance for &lsquo;location.&rsquo; The &lsquo;@mac&rsquo; context, for example, lists items that must be done while you&rsquo;re at your Mac. GTD really emphasizes the context idea, and Midnight Inbox gets this. When you get down to doing stuff, the idea is that you&rsquo;ll base what you do on your location. At the Mac? Select the @Mac section, and get working. Note that Midnight Inbox (like OmniFocus and iGTD) also synchronizes your To Do list in iCal based on contexts with no option (that I could find) to do so by project.</p>\n<p>After this phase, there is a &lsquo;Reference&rsquo; section to hold all the cats and dogs: actions that do not have a defined timeline, actions requiring an incubation period before you plan to begin working on them, ideas you wish to file for a later date, etc. I like how this section is organized ‚Äî it clearly stands apart from the rest of the workflow and is easy to view at a glance. I like how this is handled in Inbox more than the methods employed by OmniFocus or iGTD.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p>And finally, there is an &lsquo;Archive&rsquo; category where all your completed projects are stored for posterity. (Actually, there&rsquo;s also a Trash bucket after the Archive section to hold stuff you delete - handy if you accidently delete an item and later decide to recover it). These items worked as advertised, so I have nothing really to add.</p>\n<p>Oh, I forgot to mention the Yak Timer. Yes, the Yak Timer. This is a littler tickler the designer added to help you stay on track. It&rsquo;s a little reminder window that pops up at regular intervals (similar to an iCal reminder message) to help keep you focused and on track. I found it annoying. Fortunately, the Yak can be disabled from the Preferences menu. If you&rsquo;re easily distracted, you may find it handy.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I tried to use Midnight Inbox without referring to documentation, but I gave up after about thirty minutes of frustration. I usually start learning how to use a program by clicking around. This didn&rsquo;t get me far with Midnight Inbox. The biggest obstacle was a lack of intuitive control. The two prime examples of this: there are no right-click menus anywhere; and you can&rsquo;t toggle between items (such as choosing different contexts) by clicking on them ‚Äî you must go up to the Menu Bar to do so.</p>\n<p>In short, I headed for the app&rsquo;s Help files. While I found basic concepts and suggestions here, it wasn&rsquo;t really enough for me to get what I was supposed to do or how I was supposed to do it. I then shifted over to the developer&rsquo;s site and discovered a screencast tutorial. This helped a lot. I recommend you start there.</p>\n<p>I have to say that I was not expecting the program to actively go out and gather stuff on my Mac. Once I got over that, and once I learned how to add my own projects and actions independently of this &lsquo;auto collecting&rsquo; feature, it started to click. Still, some aspects of the program remain mysterious to me even now. I think a few more screencasts from the developer would be a big help.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Not really, but as I said before, I think this program will appeal to many people. Namely, I think it will appeal to those who really love the GTD process and want a program that really sticks to the GTD workflow. Still, I have to say that the more I used it, the more I appreciated it. And just when I started to really adjust to Midnight Inbox, my trial period ended.</p>\n<p>If you intend to use this program, I think you need to be prepared to commit to it in order to realize it&rsquo;s full potential. Certainly that&rsquo;s true of all of all of the GTD-based task management apps, but I felt like Midnight Inbox required an extra degree of commitment. I was unable to start adding projects and actions as easily as I did in, say, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iGTD<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniFocus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I first had to take a considerable amount of time to study how it worked. It&rsquo;s not without quirkiness ‚Äî at times it felt more like I was learning how the developer&rsquo;s mind worked. In the end, I gained a real appreciation for the time and effort that must have gone into developing this tool. I also gained an appreciation for the logic behind the workflow. Yet, I concluded it was not for me. I would like to check out version 2.0 when it arrives to see how it has changed and improved.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>While the program integrates well with Mail &amp; iCal, and successfully reaches out to gather items from any folder on my Mac, the integration still seemed limited. It has the feel of a stand-alone application. Unlike OmniFocus or iGTD, there is no Services Menu function, there are no right-click menus, and there is no Apple Dock menu. You can&rsquo;t drag and drop items around (except from within the &lsquo;Organize&rsquo; window). Nor can you synch your data with other third-party Mac applications. I also could not find an export function to get my data out of Midnight Inbox and into a text file or other export format.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. How well could I manage all of my tasks (work, home, play, etc.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t use Mail, iCal, or the other pre-sets to manage your data, you can set up new rules to collect information from different areas or programs of your choosing. However, I found my choices to be limited. I use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yojimbo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for instance, to capture notes throughout the day, but I was unable to configure Inbox to automatically collect Yojimbo notes. Presumbaly, it&rsquo;s because Inbox doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with the SQL database where the Yojimbo notes are stored. That&rsquo;s a shame ‚Äî I think more people might take the plunge and try the auto-collect idea if more types of data could be included.</p>\n<p>It appears that the only real flexibility I have is to choose a file location of my choice where Inbox should collect stored text documents or files. Yet I can&rsquo;t really imagine getting any use out of collecting text files or documents. I simply don&rsquo;t store relevant information in stand-alone text documents or files (relevant to my task management process, that is). This limits the usefulness of the auto-collection process for me (particularly because I don&rsquo;t use iCal either).</p>\n<p>Still, it&rsquo;s an intriguing idea. I think there is a bright future for this kind of application: the meta-program that aggregates data and then allows you to process (file, tag, refine, categorize, etc.) a lot of information from many different sources on your Mac in one place. I look forward to seeing how the developer refines these ideas in future versions of Midnight Inbox.</p>\n<p>Footnote: you can choose to turn off the auto-collection feature altogether from the Preferences menu if you would rather manually enter your own data.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->5. How did the program &lsquo;feel?&rsquo; How &lsquo;Mac-like&rsquo; is it?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>When I first launched Inbox, I was struck by the beauty of the user interface. The design is stunning. The look and feel of the program is undeniably like iTunes, but the metaphor breaks down there. Nothing about the program is much like iTunes when it comes to operational use. It&rsquo;s quite unique and, if my learning curve is any indication, will take the average user some time to really grasp.</p>\n<p>For example, the top menu area of the program has an interface that looks like iTunes, but I never found clear documentation to show me what I was supposed to do with that giant &lsquo;Play/Pause&rsquo; button. I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s a timer with which you can countdown the minutes you&rsquo;ve alloted for a particular action. But why would I really want to do this? For such a large prominent button, it seems like it should be more important to the program. Likewise, the giant &lsquo;check&rsquo; button to the left of the &lsquo;iTunes&rsquo; window seems to only be for checking off an item when it&rsquo;s completed. However, it&rsquo;s much easier to just check the box next to the item to indicate it&rsquo;s completed. And then there&rsquo;s the big iTunes-like window at the top. It&rsquo;s clearly an information pane to indicate your current action, project, and context, but I didn&rsquo;t find it particulary useful. This window, for instance, provides a hint to &lsquo;Select a context from the Work menu to switch active actions,&rsquo; but I found it frustrating that I had to literally go to the work menu on the Menu Bar to change contexts. Clicking on the context doesn&rsquo;t do the job, nor does double-clicking. Again, I think building in more user-entry inroads would help.</p>\n<p>Another curious interface choice is that you can&rsquo;t close the program window. The developer has disabled the &lsquo;Close&rsquo; button (I&rsquo;m talking about the red, yellow, and green buttons on the top left corner of every Mac window). You can minimize, you can toggle the size of the window, but you can&rsquo;t close the window. The only option is to &lsquo;Hide&rsquo; the program from the Menu Bar. I assume this is because you&rsquo;re not supposed to w\nant or need to close the main window once you open the program, and presumably the developer hopes that you will open the program first when you fire up your Mac. Me? I would like the choice.</p>\n<p>Next, I found the use of the double-click in this program to be unintuitive. Double-clicking is how you pull up a menu to change the parameters of each item in Inbox. You can&rsquo;t right click on anything, which I intuitively wanted to do in order to get more options. I&rsquo;ve never used a program that required me to use the menu bar choices so often (sure, there are also a plethora of shortcut keys I could use to navigate through Inbox or to add or change options, but I normally don&rsquo;t get to learning &lsquo;power user&rsquo; shortcuts until I really know a program well).</p>\n<p>So, Midnight Inbox has a way to go when it comes to that elusive &lsquo;Mac-like&rsquo; flow.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->In conclusion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: If you carry forth the intended integration of this app to it&rsquo;s full potential ‚Äî that is, if you allow it to collect a good chunk of the daily data you accumulate on your Mac and then use the program to process all of this incoming data ‚Äî it will surely be one of the most-used programs in your toolbox. But will you commit? It takes a lot of work. At times during my trial of this program, I felt like I was spending more time processing, organizing, and managing than actually getting things done.</p>\n<p>Conceptually, Midnight Inbox is not really that distant from other Mac GTD-based task management apps. It&rsquo;s closest in function and design to iGTD, in my opinion. So why did I find this program harder to use than two GTD-based task management apps I&rsquo;ve tried out? I had a hard time quantifying this. It&rsquo;s strange. In one sense, the organizational structure of this program is very logical. It very closely follows the GTD process, perhaps more than any GTD task manager I&rsquo;ve reviewed. It&rsquo;s also aesthetically pleasing.</p>\n<p>I think the issue for me lies in the way the data is managed. It&rsquo;s about the degree of flexibility. The only way I really got it working for me was to adopt the workflow planned out by the developer. I think that&rsquo;s what frustrated me. At times, I would begin to glimpse the potential of this app, only to be frustrated when I clicked on something to discover it didn&rsquo;t work the way I expected it to work. If the developer can open up the interface a bit so people can navigate around more freely, I think it would increase it&rsquo;s appeal. OmniFocus, for instance, is much more intuitive and freeform in the way it allows a user to add, sort, and categorize data. Midnight Inbox, conversely, is more about process: you need to be willing to follow a fairly rigid &lsquo;Getting Things Done&rsquo; workflow. I am personally more inclined to use a more flexible tool like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniFocus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or Cultured Code&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (which I&rsquo;ll review next).</p>\n<p>A single license for Midnight Inbox is available for $35 (which is good through version 3.0). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Midnight Beep Softworks <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is now hard at work on version 2.0 of this application. Be sure to check it out.</p>\n<p>Yet again, I want to note that &lsquo;GTD&rsquo; and &lsquo;Getting Things Done&rsquo; remain registered trademarks of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Allen &amp; Co<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "This is the fourth post in a series comparing <a href=\"/2008/01/03/2008-the-year-of-the-killer-task-management-app/\">task management applications</a> based on the '<a href=\"http://www.davidco.com/\">Getting Things Done</a>' process. Today I'll look at Midnight Beep Softworks' <a href=\"http://www.midnightbeep.com/\">Midnight Inbox 1.2.8</a>.\n\nPerhaps more than any other task management application I've explored to date, Midnight Inbox from Midnight Beep strives to be the single point of entry ‚Äî the GTD command post ‚Äî through which you organize your life.

If you don't store your essential daily work within these programs or files in your work-a-day life, or if you prefer to manually add projects and items as you dream them up, you may find auto-collection a bit too time-intensive and restricting.\n\nI say 'time intensive' because it can take considerable time and effort to process every item that Midnight Inbox sucks in (to be fair, you can adjust how much or little stuff the program draws in). I use 'restricting' here in the sense that Inbox seems designed to function as an implementation of 'Getting Things Done' first, and a general task manager second. That is, it's a program that focuses on implementing the GTD <em>process</em>. I think it does an admirable job at this, but it's important to keep in mind that this software implements a very specific workflow.\n\nThose of you who really groove on the GTD process and want a system that tightly follows this model may find this program particularly appealing. Other task management applications <a href=\"/category/organization/\">I've looked at</a> employ core GTD ideas in various ways, but they tend to offer higher levels of user-defined flexibility.

Midnight Inbox, on the other hand is, at it's core, more about following a pre-defined task management process.\n\nWhich way is better? Surely it will depend on the organizational style of the user. If you just finished reading David Allen's <a href=\"http://www.davidco.com/\">book</a>, you may really take to this model. I personally prefer the applications that follow more freeform solutions.\n<h3>The Big Picture</h3>\nSo, how does this command post work?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe workflow is cleanly broken down into iconic sections, which are stacked in a left-hand column of the application's main window. The first item on this list is the 'Collect' section, which I've already talked a lot about in previous paragraphs. This is where your collected items gather.\n\nNext is the 'Process' function. At a point of time of your choosing, you process through your collection of items. When you choose to 'Process Collections,' a new dropdown menu pops up that presents you with options for filing each item that you collect.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom this menu, you may make a new project, complete an action immediately (if it's a task you can do in less than two minutes ‚Äî a GTD concept that is well integrated in this application), or file it away for the future. Curiously, you can't assign a context at this stage (keep reading if you're not sure what a context is). I like how Midnight Inbox handles processing: the dropdown menu is well-ordered, clear, and concise.\n\nNext, you move on to the 'Organize' phase. As you might suspect, this is the stage at which you organize your stuff. Here, you may assign a context to an action, add new actions, add new projects, assign how often you'd like to review a given project, etc. Midnight Beep describes the 'Organize' phase as the 'heart of the Inbox experience.' It's the place where, at a glance, you may view and reorganize all of the projects and associated actions you've gathered. The organization phase focuses on refinement of your projects, categories, and contexts.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI should note that you can also choose to add new projects, actions, etc. on the fly here as the need arises (which is essential ‚Äî auto-collection is not likely to capture everything you need to act upon in your daily life. Clearly, though, the intent is that the auto-collection process will capture most of the important stuff).\n\nNext is 'Review,' which will be familiar to those of you who know GTD. The basic idea is this: according to the GTD model, you should periodically review your open actions and projects to see if they are still correctly filed, within the correct context and project, etc. This is how you stay on track and keep all your actions in tidy order. This phase is fairly intuitive and similar to other GTD-based apps Ive looked at. Helpfully, the developer builds in pre-defined 'Reviews' that you can select from a dropdown list while in the 'Organize' phase. To initiate a review, you can either use an assigned shortcut key or choose a review option from the Menu Bar.\n\nNext on the list is the 'Work' category. This is the phase where you may view your actions organized by context. 'Context' is GTD parlance for 'location.' The '@mac' context, for example, lists items that must be done while you're at your Mac. GTD really emphasizes the context idea, and Midnight Inbox gets this. When you get down to doing stuff, the idea is that you'll base what you do on your location. At the Mac? Select the @Mac section, and get working. Note that Midnight Inbox (like OmniFocus and iGTD) also synchronizes your To Do list in iCal based on contexts with no option (that I could find) to do so by project.\n\nAfter this phase, there is a 'Reference' section to hold all the cats and dogs: actions that do not have a defined timeline, actions requiring an incubation period before you plan to begin working on them, ideas you wish to file for a later date, etc. I like how this section is organized ‚Äî it clearly stands apart from the rest of the workflow and is easy to view at a glance. I like how this is handled in Inbox more than the methods employed by OmniFocus or iGTD.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd finally, there is an 'Archive' category where all your completed projects are stored for posterity. (Actually, there's also a Trash bucket after the Archive section to hold stuff you delete - handy if you accidently delete an item and later decide to recover it). These items worked as advertised, so I have nothing really to add.\n\nOh, I forgot to mention the Yak Timer. Yes, the Yak Timer. This is a littler tickler the designer added to help you stay on track. It's a little reminder window that pops up at regular intervals (similar to an iCal reminder message) to help keep you focused and on track. I found it annoying. Fortunately, the Yak can be disabled from the Preferences menu. If you're easily distracted, you may find it handy.\n<h3>The Verdict</h3>\n<em>1. Could I figure out how to use the application with minimal fuss (preferably without referring to documentation)?</em>\n\nI tried to use Midnight Inbox without referring to documentation, but I gave up after about thirty minutes of frustration. I usually start learning how to use a program by clicking around. This didn't get me far with Midnight Inbox. The biggest obstacle was a lack of intuitive control.

I then shifted over to the developer's site and discovered a screencast tutorial. This helped a lot.

Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?</em>\n\nNot really, but as I said before, I think this program will appeal to many people. Namely, I think it will appeal to those who really love the GTD process and want a program that really sticks to the GTD workflow. Still, I have to say that the more I used it, the more I appreciated it. And just when I started to really adjust to Midnight Inbox, my trial period ended.\n\nIf you intend to use this program, I think you need to be prepared to commit to it in order to realize it's full potential. Certainly that's true of all of all of the GTD-based task management apps, but I felt like Midnight Inbox required an extra degree of commitment. I was unable to start adding projects and actions as easily as I did in, say, <a href=\"http://www.igtd.pl/iGTD/\">iGTD</a> or <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/\">OmniFocus</a>. I first had to take a considerable amount of time to study how it worked. It's not without quirkiness ‚Äî at times it felt more like I was learning how the developer's mind worked. In the end, I gained a real appreciation for the time and effort that must have gone into developing this tool. I also gained an appreciation for the logic behind the workflow. Yet, I concluded it was not for me. I would like to check out version 2.0 when it arrives to see how it has changed and improved.\n\n<em>3. How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?</em>\n\nWhile the program integrates well with Mail &amp; iCal, and successfully reaches out to gather items from any folder on my Mac, the integration still seemed limited. It has the feel of a stand-alone application. Unlike OmniFocus or iGTD, there is no Services Menu function, there are no right-click menus, and there is no Apple Dock menu. You can't drag and drop items around (except from within the 'Organize' window). Nor can you synch your data with other third-party Mac applications. I also could not find an export function to get my data out of Midnight Inbox and into a text file or other export format.\n\n<em>4. How well could I manage all of my tasks (work, home, play, etc.)</em>\n\nIf you don't use Mail, iCal, or the other pre-sets to manage your data, you can set up new rules to collect information from different areas or programs of your choosing. However, I found my choices to be limited. I use <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/\">Yojimbo</a>, for instance, to capture notes throughout the day, but I was unable to configure Inbox to automatically collect Yojimbo notes. Presumbaly, it's because Inbox doesn't know what to do with the SQL database where the Yojimbo notes are stored. That's a shame ‚Äî I think more people might take the plunge and try the auto-collect idea if more types of data could be included.\n\nIt appears that the only real flexibility I have is to choose a file location of my choice where Inbox should collect stored text documents or files. Yet I can't really imagine getting any use out of collecting text files or documents. I simply don't store relevant information in stand-alone text documents or files (relevant to my task management process, that is). This limits the usefulness of the auto-collection process for me (particularly because I don't use iCal either).\n\nStill, it's an intriguing idea. I think there is a bright future for this kind of application: the meta-program that aggregates data and then allows you to process (file, tag, refine, categorize, etc.) a lot of information from many different sources on your Mac in one place. I look forward to seeing how the developer refines these ideas in future versions of Midnight Inbox.\n\nFootnote: you can choose to turn off the auto-collection feature altogether from the Preferences menu if you would rather manually enter your own data.\n\n<em>5. How did the program 'feel?' How 'Mac-like' is it?</em>\n\nWhen I first launched Inbox, I was struck by the beauty of the user interface. The design is stunning. The look and feel of the program is undeniably like iTunes, but the metaphor breaks down there. Nothing about the program is much like iTunes when it comes to operational use. It's quite unique and, if my learning curve is any indication, will take the average user some time to really grasp.\n\nFor example, the top menu area of the program has an interface that looks like iTunes, but I never found clear documentation to show me what I was supposed to do with that giant 'Play/Pause' button. I'm guessing it's a timer with which you can countdown the minutes you've alloted for a particular action. But why would I really want to do this? For such a large prominent button, it seems like it should be more important to the program. Likewise, the giant 'check' button to the left of the 'iTunes' window seems to only be for checking off an item when it's completed. However, it's much easier to just check the box next to the item to indicate it's completed. And then there's the big iTunes-like window at the top. It's clearly an information pane to indicate your current action, project, and context, but I didn't find it particulary useful. This window, for instance, provides a hint to 'Select a context from the Work menu to switch active actions,' but I found it frustrating that I had to literally go to the work menu on the Menu Bar to change contexts. Clicking on the context doesn't do the job, nor does double-clicking. Again, I think building in more user-entry inroads would help.\n\nAnother curious interface choice is that you can't close the program window. The developer has disabled the 'Close' button (I'm talking about the red, yellow, and green buttons on the top left corner of every Mac window). You can minimize, you can toggle the size of the window, but you can't close the window. The only option is to 'Hide' the program from the Menu Bar. I assume this is because you're not supposed to w\nant or need to close the main window once you open the program, and presumably the developer hopes that you will open the program first when you fire up your Mac. Me? I would like the choice.\n\nNext, I found the use of the double-click in this program to be unintuitive. Double-clicking is how you pull up a menu to change the parameters of each item in Inbox. You can't right click on anything, which I intuitively wanted to do in order to get more options. I've never used a program that required me to use the menu bar choices so often (sure, there are also a plethora of shortcut keys I could use to navigate through Inbox or to add or change options, but I normally don't get to learning 'power user' shortcuts until I really know a program well).\n\nSo, Midnight Inbox has a way to go when it comes to that elusive 'Mac-like' flow.<strong>In conclusion</strong>: If you carry forth the intended integration of this app to it's full potential ‚Äî that is, if you allow it to collect a good chunk of the daily data you accumulate on your Mac and then use the program to process all of this incoming data ‚Äî it will surely be one of the most-used programs in your toolbox. But will you commit? It takes a lot of work. At times during my trial of this program, I felt like I was spending more time processing, organizing, and managing than actually getting things done.\n\nConceptually, Midnight Inbox is not really that distant from other Mac GTD-based task management apps. It's closest in function and design to iGTD, in my opinion. So why did I find this program harder to use than two GTD-based task management apps I've tried out? I had a hard time quantifying this. It's strange. In one sense, the organizational structure of this program is very logical. It very closely follows the GTD process, perhaps more than any GTD task manager I've reviewed. It's also aesthetically pleasing.\n\nI think the issue for me lies in the way the data is managed. It's about the degree of flexibility. The only way I really got it working for me was to adopt the workflow planned out by the developer. I think that's what frustrated me. At times, I would begin to glimpse the potential of this app, only to be frustrated when I clicked on something to discover it didn't work the way I expected it to work. If the developer can open up the interface a bit so people can navigate around more freely, I think it would increase it's appeal. OmniFocus, for instance, is much more intuitive and freeform in the way it allows a user to add, sort, and categorize data. Midnight Inbox, conversely, is more about process: you need to be willing to follow a fairly rigid 'Getting Things Done' workflow. I am personally more inclined to use a more flexible tool like <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/\">OmniFocus</a> or Cultured Code's <a href=\"http://www.culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a> (which I'll review next).\n\nA single license for Midnight Inbox is available for $35 (which is good through version 3.0). <a href=\"http://www.midnightbeep.com/\">Midnight Beep Softworks </a>is now hard at work on version 2.0 of this application. Be sure to check it out.\n\nYet again, I want to note that 'GTD' and 'Getting Things Done' remain registered trademarks of <a href=\"http://www.davidco.com/\">David Allen &amp; Co</a>.\n",

				"title": "GTD Task Management Apps III: OmniFocus",
				"content_html": "<p>This is the third post in a series comparing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->task management applications<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that are based to some degree on the &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Things Done<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; process. Today I&rsquo;ll look at OmniGroup&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniFocus 1.0<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>OmniFocus is the latest offering from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniGroup<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, one of the most well-respected software developers for the Mac. As a long-time user of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OmniWeb<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (my casual browser of choice), I&rsquo;ve found OmniGroup to be quick to respond, helpful and friendly when contacted for support. This is a solid company, in other words, so I entered this evaluation full of optimism. I began using this app while it was still in Beta, and I&rsquo;m now using the free 14-day trial of version 1.0 (which launched on Jan. 7). I did not opt to buy the program while it was still in Beta (for a limited time, Beta users could buy it for ). The program now cost , which is perhaps the most notable thing to say about OmniFocus. It&rsquo;s expensive. Is it worth it? Before I get to that, let&rsquo;s take a look at the program.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Once you enter some actions, you assign them to projects and contexts (easy to choose from a dropdown list). Once you make all of your choices, you hit the &lsquo;Clean Up&rsquo; icon on the top menu bar, and your items magically file themselves away, disappearing from the inbox.</p>\n<p>This is similar to the &lsquo;Process/Review&rsquo; function in iGTD, but I like the OmniFocus method because it&rsquo;s easier. In iGTD, processing and reviewing all happens from the same tool (&lsquo;Process/Review&rsquo;). With iGTD, you use keyboard shortcuts to fly through your tasks (iGTD calls them tasks, OmniFocus calls the actions) to re-sort or verify your contexts or projects, change a task&rsquo;s status, etc.</p>\n<p>In OmniFocus, you assign each tasks as many or as few parameters you want, and then &lsquo;Clean Up.&rsquo; At it&rsquo;s most basic, you can just assign a project and/or a context. At it&rsquo;s most complex, you can assign each action a wide variety of parameters, which I&rsquo;ll cover when I talk about the Inspector (since that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll find these choices). Unlike iGTD, the &lsquo;reviewing&rsquo; part of OmniFocus is a distinct feature, separated from the initial &lsquo;processing&rsquo; of your actions. I&rsquo;ll cover this shortly as well.</p>\n<p>This workflow ‚Äî dump actions in, add some specific parameters or goalposts, then dispatch the actions off with &lsquo;Clean Up&rsquo; ‚Äî is easy for me to grasp, and I like to see my Inbox empty when I clean up. It&rsquo;s a bit of nice user feedback that makes me feel, well, organized (or at least approaching organization).</p>\n<p>In the screenshot [Note: screenshots removed], you&rsquo;ll also see some simple built-in color coding that appears once you assign due dates to your actions. The red text indicates an action that is past due; orange means it is due today. Easy enough. So far, this doesn&rsquo;t do anything that iGTD doesn&rsquo;t do.</p>\n<p>Where it differs is in design and workflow. It&rsquo;s obvious that the team who designed OmniFocus were striving for clean lines and simplicity while maintaining industrial-strength power under the hood. In effect, the powerful sorting/viewing guts of the app are carefully arranged and hidden until called upon by the user, whereas iGTD presents so many options and choices up-front, it feels as if you&rsquo;re looking at the guts.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In the screenshot, you&rsquo;ll see a list of actions that are due that I can only do when I am using my Mac. Note that only items in each project that can be accomplished while using the Mac are shown in this view. This is handy. The way that OmniFocus handles contexts, and the sorting and viewing of contexts, works for me. It&rsquo;s intuitive and orderly.</p>\n<p>One feature that sticks out is the ability to nest contexts within other contexts. For example, I have &lsquo;email&rsquo; and &lsquo;online&rsquo; as nested subcategories under &lsquo;Mac.&rsquo; While this sounded good to me in theory, in practice it was more organization than I needed. It was enough for me to simply identify &lsquo;Mac&rsquo; as a context. I don&rsquo;t need or want additional sub-categories. However, I readily admit that this will be very handy for users with more &lsquo;to do&rsquo; than me, namely business users (and those who like to be really, really organized).</p>\n<p>Also note that some actions in the Context screenshot are purple. OmniFocus tries to be helpful by displaying certain colors for your actions. This can be useful, but it can also be confusing. Take the purple action: purple actions are the next items to do on your list. When you create a project, you can choose if the actions must be done one after the other (sequential) or in any order (parallel). A purple action means this is the next suggested action to do in your project (if order doesn&rsquo;t matter) or it means that this is the next action you must to before you proceed to the next action (if order does matter). Personally, I think the purple text should only be used where order is important. If order is unimportant to me, I don&rsquo;t need to have the first item on a parallel list to be highlighted. It&rsquo;s not necessary.</p>\n<p>Final word on the Context screenshot: you&rsquo;ll note that I highlighted the &lsquo;View&rsquo; bar, which I&rsquo;ll discuss in brief next.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>¬†</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It&rsquo;s so simple, I have nothing else to say about it.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Now we&rsquo;ll take a brief look at the OmniFocus review process (screenshot 5). The idea here is that you must periodically flip through all of your projects and actions to make sure they are still relevant, that they haven&rsquo;t changed, and that they are filed correctly (in terms of due dates, status, etc.). OmniFocus tries to make this painless by automatically setting up a review process based on the time that you entered the data. This view (the &lsquo;review view&rsquo;) can be, um, viewed by selecting the choice from the &lsquo;group projects by&rsquo; view drop-down list. What&rsquo;s important here is that the program tells you what you should review by week and within the month, and you are presented with a right-menu option to mark each project as reviewed (once you do this, that project will automatically be rescheduled for review in a few weeks). This is a pretty good way to handle the review process, which is one of the GTD process steps to ensure you are staying on track with your actions and projects. If you&rsquo;re like me, though, you may find this a little tedious. The &lsquo;Review View&rsquo; is yet another example of just how many different ways a user can rearrange actions and projects via the View Bar. It&rsquo;s truly amazing, truly powerful, and potentially truly confusing.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>At any rate, the Inspector is one of those Mac-like ways to stick a ton of metadata in one place and get it away from your main application window, presumably because we Mac users like our main window to stay clean and lean. I like that the program is smart enough to interpret what I enter in the &lsquo;date&rsquo; and &lsquo;time&rsquo; fields of the Inspector: you can type any of the following: &lsquo;2d,&rsquo; &lsquo;3 mo,&rsquo; &lsquo;45m,&rsquo; &lsquo;next wed 1pm&rsquo; &hellip; and OmniFocus will interpret the date and time correctly.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Perspectives&rsquo; (the other info pane in screenshot 6) is, as far as I know, an idea unique to OmniFocus. Essentially, a Perspective is a way to capture a certain view for later. This little organizational tool is like a super-bookmark: it reminds me of a similar OmniWeb feature which allows one to take snapshots of all open pages and current views on those pages to save for later. I love this feature. It&rsquo;s a nice idea for OmniFocus ‚Äî especially if, over time, you discover that you really like one particular view (or three or four) and would like to get back to that view quickly at a later time. Given the hundreds of viewing combinations one can choose from in this program, it&rsquo;s a good idea to give the user a way to store it. The one potential pitfall of this is that you must remember you are storing a snapshot of all your data in one particular viewing state. If you forget this, you might choose to view a Perspective and incorrectly think that some of your data is missing! It&rsquo;s not missing, of course, it&rsquo;s just that your &lsquo;Perspective&rsquo; only includes a subset of all of your data.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>¬†</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>No. I had to view the tutorial video and read the tutorial help files to really get going.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Yes and no. I have a lot of respect for OmniGroup. I am impressed that they brought in productivity gurus to try to get this application done right. I can see that they tried hard to make it simple enough for basic use but powerful enough for serious business use. I think it&rsquo;s a great start. I was still excited about the potential of this app a week later, but all of the sorting, viewing, and tagging options started to weigh on me. It&rsquo;s too much work! I began to feel that I was spending too much time planning and not enough time doing. To get the most out of this complex app, I think the secret would be to stick with it for a long time ‚Äî you would have to commit to it, get to know it inside and out, develop routines and workflows that work for you. Then, I imagine the curve would change: it will begin to feel more like a a powerful tool that helps you get more done instead of a powerful tool with too many options.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Pretty good. Good integration for system-wide data entry (so you can easily enter new items, even when the program is hidden or closed). Not as many options for integration with other apps as iGTD (in fact, I think there is only iCal integration right now).</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. How well could I manage all of my tasks (work, home, play, etc.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>It did a good job of keeping track of the things I had to get done, but I found myself playing with the View options too often. I kept adding more metadata so I could use the various sort options to see how they worked. In other words, maybe there are too many options.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->5. How did the program &lsquo;feel?&rsquo; How &lsquo;Mac-like&rsquo; is it?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>I think the user experience is good, but not great. The application is very Mac-like, in that I immediately knew how to move data around. I like the clever way that OmniGroup embedded the Views and Perspectives ‚Äî when you step back and look at all the sorting and viewing tools they squeezed in there and then ponder how clean the user interface still looks, it&rsquo;s an impressive feat. The question is: are there simply too many viewing and tagging options? I felt bogged down in the end.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In conclusion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: this will likely be one of the top three GTD-based task managers. It&rsquo;s a solid program ‚Äî and it&rsquo;s only at version 1.0. However, it costs too much for most Mac users. Those who are willing to plunk down for this will likely be serious business users who are serious about task management. The rest of us?

				"content_text": "This is the third post in a series comparing <a href=\"/2008/01/03/2008-the-year-of-the-killer-task-management-app/\">task management applications</a> that are based to some degree on the '<a href=\"http://www.davidco.com/\">Getting Things Done</a>' process. Today I'll look at OmniGroup's <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/\">OmniFocus 1.0</a>.\n\nOmniFocus is the latest offering from <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/\">OmniGroup</a>, one of the most well-respected software developers for the Mac. As a long-time user of <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb\">OmniWeb</a> (my casual browser of choice), I've found OmniGroup to be quick to respond, helpful and friendly when contacted for support. This is a solid company, in other words, so I entered this evaluation full of optimism. I began using this app while it was still in Beta, and I'm now using the free 14-day trial of version 1.0 (which launched on Jan. 7). I did not opt to buy the program while it was still in Beta (for a limited time, Beta users could buy it for ). The program now cost , which is perhaps the most notable thing to say about OmniFocus. It's expensive. Is it worth it? Before I get to that, let's take a look at the program.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>The Inbox</h3>\nThe OmniFocus Inbox is likely where you'll start out, and where you'll spend a lot of time (see Screenshot 1). Do yourself a favor: when you download the trial for this app, begin by viewing the available overview on their website to get a feel for it. I also found the tutorials in the Help files of the program to be simple and easy to follow, which I can't say for many of the programs I use. Then jump in and start adding some actions. Actions, in GTD terms, are either single things that you need to do or steps you take to complete a given project (the Project is a pretty straight-forward concept, so I'm not going to focus on it here). Adding actions is easy: click, type, enter some text, then hit Return for the next action.\n\nOnce you enter some actions, you assign them to projects and contexts (easy to choose from a dropdown list). Once you make all of your choices, you hit the 'Clean Up' icon on the top menu bar, and your items magically file themselves away, disappearing from the inbox.\n\nThis is similar to the 'Process/Review' function in iGTD, but I like the OmniFocus method because it's easier. In iGTD, processing and reviewing all happens from the same tool ('Process/Review'). With iGTD, you use keyboard shortcuts to fly through your tasks (iGTD calls them tasks, OmniFocus calls the actions) to re-sort or verify your contexts or projects, change a task's status, etc.\n\nIn OmniFocus, you assign each tasks as many or as few parameters you want, and then 'Clean Up.' At it's most basic, you can just assign a project and/or a context. At it's most complex, you can assign each action a wide variety of parameters, which I'll cover when I talk about the Inspector (since that's where you'll find these choices). Unlike iGTD, the 'reviewing' part of OmniFocus is a distinct feature, separated from the initial 'processing' of your actions. I'll cover this shortly as well.\n\nThis workflow ‚Äî dump actions in, add some specific parameters or goalposts, then dispatch the actions off with 'Clean Up' ‚Äî is easy for me to grasp, and I like to see my Inbox empty when I clean up. It's a bit of nice user feedback that makes me feel, well, organized (or at least approaching organization).\n\nIn the screenshot [Note: screenshots removed], you'll also see some simple built-in color coding that appears once you assign due dates to your actions. The red text indicates an action that is past due; orange means it is due today. Easy enough. So far, this doesn't do anything that iGTD doesn't do.\n\nWhere it differs is in design and workflow. It's obvious that the team who designed OmniFocus were striving for clean lines and simplicity while maintaining industrial-strength power under the hood. In effect, the powerful sorting/viewing guts of the app are carefully arranged and hidden until called upon by the user, whereas iGTD presents so many options and choices up-front, it feels as if you're looking at the guts.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Contexts</h3>\nWhile the term may vary, all of the GTD-based Mac task managers have a way to deal with the idea of 'context.' OmniFocus calls this idea, aptly, Contexts. Simply stated, contexts allow you to organize your lists based on where you are (see Screenshot 2). I think OmniFocus performs about as well as any of the apps in this review series when it comes to managing <em>by location</em>. They get high scores for making their user interface work as you would expect. Indeed, the interface (the means to add or subtract an item, for instance) will be familiar to you from other Mac apps. That's a good thing.\n\nIn the screenshot, you'll see a list of actions that are due that I can only do when I am using my Mac. Note that only items in each project that can be accomplished while using the Mac are shown in this view. This is handy. The way that OmniFocus handles contexts, and the sorting and viewing of contexts, works for me. It's intuitive and orderly.\n\nOne feature that sticks out is the ability to nest contexts within other contexts. For example, I have 'email' and 'online' as nested subcategories under 'Mac.' While this sounded good to me in theory, in practice it was more organization than I needed. It was enough for me to simply identify 'Mac' as a context. I don't need or want additional sub-categories. However, I readily admit that this will be very handy for users with more 'to do' than me, namely business users (and those who like to be really, really organized).\n\nAlso note that some actions in the Context screenshot are purple. OmniFocus tries to be helpful by displaying certain colors for your actions. This can be useful, but it can also be confusing. Take the purple action: purple actions are the next items to do on your list. When you create a project, you can choose if the actions must be done one after the other (sequential) or in any order (parallel). A purple action means this is the next suggested action to do in your project (if order doesn't matter) or it means that this is the next action you must to before you proceed to the next action (if order does matter). Personally, I think the purple text should only be used where order is important. If order is unimportant to me, I don't need to have the first item on a parallel list to be highlighted. It's not necessary.\n\nFinal word on the Context screenshot: you'll note that I highlighted the 'View' bar, which I'll discuss in brief next.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>What's in a View</h3>\nThe View Bar (screenshot 3) is a fairly ingenious tool. Thankfully, the designers thought to add a subtle hint in each of the view options to remind you what it's supposed to do ('Show Actions with Status:' for instance is a nice clue that you're about to sort your actions by 'status'). The screenshot displays the dropdown menu for the Projects view. By way of example, you can change which projects are displayed by choosing from the following dropdown menu choices: remaining, active, stalled, pending, on hold, dropped, completed. Yikes. Is my project pending or is it on hold? Or maybe it's stalled? My brain is starting to hurt. Several of the other 'View' groups have similarly vexing choices. All I can say is, 'try them out. Play with it. See what it does.' I'll warn you though: it can start to get confusing when you mix and match view options. It's easy to lose 'where you are' in your data. Here's the good news: you don't necessarily need to use these power sorting and viewing options. You can use just a couple, or none. I think the developers, in offering this plethora of viewing and sorting choice, are aiming at people who need to balance hundreds of tasks and dozens of projects. I can see how sorting and grouping and flagging and estimating time duration, etc. could be helpful for these people. But not for me.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Focus</h3>\nNow here's a feature I really like (screenshot 4): the Focus. This is a simple idea, and it's a useful idea. When you highlight a project and click the 'Focus' button on the menu bar, you will only see that project and its associated actions. The 'Focus' button will then change to read 'Show All' ... allowing you to quickly toggle back to the see all of your projects.\n\nIt's so simple, I have nothing else to say about it.\n<h3>Review</h3>\n&nbsp;\n\nNow we'll take a brief look at the OmniFocus review process (screenshot 5). The idea here is that you must periodically flip through all of your projects and actions to make sure they are still relevant, that they haven't changed, and that they are filed correctly (in terms of due dates, status, etc.). OmniFocus tries to make this painless by automatically setting up a review process based on the time that you entered the data. This view (the 'review view') can be, um, viewed by selecting the choice from the 'group projects by' view drop-down list. What's important here is that the program tells you what you should review by week and within the month, and you are presented with a right-menu option to mark each project as reviewed (once you do this, that project will automatically be rescheduled for review in a few weeks). This is a pretty good way to handle the review process, which is one of the GTD process steps to ensure you are staying on track with your actions and projects. If you're like me, though, you may find this a little tedious. The 'Review View' is yet another example of just how many different ways a user can rearrange actions and projects via the View Bar. It's truly amazing, truly powerful, and potentially truly confusing.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Inspector &amp; Perspectives</h3>\nThese two items should probably not be lumped together because they are do different things. The one thing they have in common is that they both open up in separate floating panes. The Inspector pane is similar to many other Mac apps (Pages has a similar pane). Here, you can add even options for your projects, actions, contexts, and groups such as status, due dates, etc. Note that 'group' is one of the options here. I'm still not sure where these groups are, how I create one, and how I'm supposed to use the Inspector to further tag them. I stopped looking, to be honest, after mousing around for a few minutes. I have so many levels of organization in this program, do I really need to group items beyond placing them in projects?\n\nAt any rate, the Inspector is one of those Mac-like ways to stick a ton of metadata in one place and get it away from your main application window, presumably because we Mac users like our main window to stay clean and lean. I like that the program is smart enough to interpret what I enter in the 'date' and 'time' fields of the Inspector: you can type any of the following: '2d,' '3 mo,' '45m,' 'next wed 1pm' ... and OmniFocus will interpret the date and time correctly.\n\n'Perspectives' (the other info pane in screenshot 6) is, as far as I know, an idea unique to OmniFocus. Essentially, a Perspective is a way to capture a certain view for later. This little organizational tool is like a super-bookmark: it reminds me of a similar OmniWeb feature which allows one to take snapshots of all open pages and current views on those pages to save for later. I love this feature. It's a nice idea for OmniFocus ‚Äî especially if, over time, you discover that you really like one particular view (or three or four) and would like to get back to that view quickly at a later time. Given the hundreds of viewing combinations one can choose from in this program, it's a good idea to give the user a way to store it. The one potential pitfall of this is that you must remember you are storing a snapshot of all your data in one particular viewing state. If you forget this, you might choose to view a Perspective and incorrectly think that some of your data is missing! It's not missing, of course, it's just that your 'Perspective' only includes a subset of all of your data.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Quick Entry</h3>\nI want to point out that OmniFocus offers what, for me, is essential: the ability to invoke a new action from anywhere at anytime on the Mac (screenshot 7). OmniFocus allows you to choose your own shortcut for this. It's simple and straightforward. Since I love Services, I want to point out that the app also places a little OmniFocus shortcut in your Apple Services menu. This allows you to select some text in any application and quickly insert it into a new OmniFocus action (even when the program is not open). While not all apps require the ability to enter data on the fly, apps like OmniFocus really do. You'll find yourself using it a lot more once you get used to quick system-wide data entry shortcuts.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>The OmniFocus Right Click menu (Dock)</h3>\nI thought I'd show you this final screenshot just as as indicator of the thought process that went into the application. I think it's telling that the right-click menu focuses on Contexts. OmniFocus does seem to favor them ‚Äî apparently iCal also synchs based on contexts. This isn't necessarily a bad thing: I frankly never organized my task lists based on location before trying out these types of programs. It's a way of thinking that some will love and some will probably find abhorrent. Me? I tend to think in terms of projects, so I would rather see projects in a quick-access list. Better yet, I'd like the ability to toggle between projects and contexts.\n<h3>The Verdict</h3>\n<em>1. Could I figure out how to use the application with minimal fuss (preferably without referring to documentation)?</em>\n\nNo. I had to view the tutorial video and read the tutorial help files to really get going.\n\n<em>2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?</em>\n\nYes and no. I have a lot of respect for OmniGroup. I am impressed that they brought in productivity gurus to try to get this application done right. I can see that they tried hard to make it simple enough for basic use but powerful enough for serious business use. I think it's a great start. I was still excited about the potential of this app a week later, but all of the sorting, viewing, and tagging options started to weigh on me. It's too much work! I began to feel that I was spending too much time planning and not enough time doing. To get the most out of this complex app, I think the secret would be to stick with it for a long time ‚Äî you would have to commit to it, get to know it inside and out, develop routines and workflows that work for you. Then, I imagine the curve would change: it will begin to feel more like a a powerful tool that helps you get more done instead of a powerful tool with too many options.\n\n<em>3. How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?</em>\n\nPretty good. Good integration for system-wide data entry (so you can easily enter new items, even when the program is hidden or closed). Not as many options for integration with other apps as iGTD (in fact, I think there is only iCal integration right now).\n\n<em>4. How well could I manage all of my tasks (work, home, play, etc.)</em>\n\nIt did a good job of keeping track of the things I had to get done, but I found myself playing with the View options too often. I kept adding more metadata so I could use the various sort options to see how they worked. In other words, maybe there are too many options.\n\n<em>5. How did the program 'feel?' How 'Mac-like' is it?</em>\n\nI think the user experience is good, but not great. The application is very Mac-like, in that I immediately knew how to move data around. I like the clever way that OmniGroup embedded the Views and Perspectives ‚Äî when you step back and look at all the sorting and viewing tools they squeezed in there and then ponder how clean the user interface still looks, it's an impressive feat. The question is: are there simply too many viewing and tagging options? I felt bogged down in the end.\n\n<strong>In conclusion</strong>: this will likely be one of the top three GTD-based task managers. It's a solid program ‚Äî and it's only at version 1.0. However, it costs too much for most Mac users. Those who are willing to plunk down for this will likely be serious business users who are serious about task management. The rest of us? I for one am still still seeking something a little easier to grasp, an even simpler user interface, perhaps a few less options, and a lower price point.\n\nOnce again, I want to point out that 'GTD' and 'Getting Things Done' are registered trademarks of <a href=\"http://www.davidco.com/\">David Allen &amp; Co</a>. I still don't want to get sued.\n",

And here's more unsolicited praise for TextExpander ‚Äî it saves me an amazing amount of time (I just used it to add the previous Em dash). My wife is a devoted user, too. She uses TextExpander to save keystrokes on her <a href=\"http://www.threetastes.com\">website</a>.\n\nNow I am going to try to get Adobe to fix their Creative Suite. Unfortunately, I must still switch to the QWERTY keyboard layout when I'm using PhotoShop and the other Adobe apps, and I shouldn't have to do this. Maybe it will be fixed if <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2008/pulpit_20080111_003899.html\">Apple buys Adobe</a>!\n\nIf you do your typing on a Mac and you use Dvorak, I want to ensure you know that you can quickly toggle between Qwerty and Dvorak (or Dvorak-Qwerty, or other languages). Once you enable these option in the <strong>International Preference Pane</strong> (found under Apple's <strong>System Preferences</strong>), you can choose to show this input menu in the <strong>Apple Menu Bar</strong>. You may then quickly toggle between the different keyboard layouts using a keyboard shortcut of your choice (I use <em>option-command-space</em>).\n\nA quick reminder: if you use Windows, check out SkyEnergy's <a href=\"http://www.skynergy.com/hotkeyz.html\">HotKeyz</a>. This little freeware program allows you to easily remap shortcut keys (paste, save, copy, etc.) to match the QWERTY key positions while using the Dvorak layout. It works quite well.\n\nFinally, I want to point out a new development that is full of potential for those of us who use alternative typing layouts. I don't know about you, but I'd like to look down at my keyboard and actually see the Dvorak layout. I may be able to do just that in the not-to-distant future. Check out this <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/01/04/apples-oled-keyboard-patent-optimus-maximus-watch-out\">ArsTechnica report</a> about a recent Apple patent for a dynamically controlled keyboard.\n\nImagine a keyboard with organic LEDs on each key. If you're curious about the possibilities, see <a href=\"http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/\">Art Lebedev's Optimus Maximus</a> (it's available now, if you can afford it). I imagine a future Apple keyboard that displays the Dvorak keys, then dynamically displays QWERTY keys when I press a command-key combination. And I envision my keyboard dynamically changing to display game-specific commands or key combinations for shortcut-intensive programs like Photoshop or Final Cut Studio. This is surely the keyboard of the future, and I can't wait to get one.\n",

				"content_text": "This is the second post in a series comparing <a href=\"/2008/01/03/2008-the-year-of-the-killer-task-management-app/\">task management applications</a> that are based on the '<a href=\"http://www.davidco.com/\">Getting Things Done</a>' process. I'll begin with a look at bartek:bargiel's <a href=\"http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/\">iGTD 1.4.5.6</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I started testing this application out many months ago, right about the time that I started to learn more about the GTD process. This little application was then generating (and continues to generate) a lot of buzz: it's powerful, it's free (well, it's actually <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donationware\">donationware</a>, so it's a nice idea to give the developer some cash if you intend to keep using it) and it integrates nicely with many other Mac apps (e.g. it can synch with .Mac, synch with an iPhone, and meshes nicely with <a href=\"http://www.blacktree.com/\">QuickSilver</a>, the very capable and elegant data management and application launcher).</p>\n\n<p>The Poland-based developer who created this program (who apparently developed this on his free time; he has a day job according to his profile) integrates the core ideas of the Getting Things Done model very well. The application is updated and improved with amazing frequency &mdash; it seems that every time I launch it, there's a new version available. I don't know when this guy sleeps.</p>\n\n\n<p>I find the user-interface of iGTD to be both interesting and daunting. I admit I have a weakness for lots of options, and in this department iGTD excels. That's the interesting part: it presents you with an amazing amount of control for organizing your stuff. But all of these options come at a price. There are so many choices that it may make your head hurt. Check out the first screenshot (on the left) to see what the application looks like. At the simplest level, iGTD organizes your 'to do' items in two main ways: via 'contexts' and 'projects.' A <em>context</em> is simply a way to denote 'where I will do this task.' In screenshot #1, you'll see that the context for the item 'post iGTD review' is the 'computer.' In other words, I will post this review only when I'm at my computer. I can then add this item to a 'project' of my choice. In screenshot #1, I'm about to add the 'post iGTD review' item to the 'my website' project. This simple bit of organization allows me to quickly see what I have to do by context and what I need to do by project. I can choose which view I want by selecting the appropriate button on the menu bar of the application. When I view my items by context, iGTD displays what project each item in that context belongs to. When I view by project, I see what context each item in that projects belongs to. Make sense? You may want to download the trial from the developers site and try it out to better understand this. By way of example, I could have two items in my 'at the computer' context. When I sit down at the iMac, I say to myself, \"Let's see what I'm supposed to do while I'm here at the computer.\" I see that I have two items: one is to post this review. The project for that item is called 'my website.' The other item is to 'back up my data.' The project for this one is 'mac management.' So, iGTD offers a a handy way to organize, particularly when you're dealing with a lot of items. I like how iGTD manages contexts and projects. It makes sense. But let's take a step back &mdash; the first thing your supposed to do if you follow the 'GTD workflow' is to transfer all those dozens or hundreds of things you have 'to do' from your head to the computer. For that you use the 'inbox.'</p>\n\n<p>The inbox is simply a collection point for all your 'to do' items. When you're ready (that is, when you're done entering items and your brain is empty), you can start processing and categorizing those items to help you get better organized. I found that the easiest way to do this with iGTD is to drag items to the appropriate context (drag 'get groceries' to the 'errand' context, for instance ... and note that you can create whatever context you want), and then double-click in the 'Project' field for that item and choose a project to add it to (or create a new one). These ideas (placing your tasks in an inbox, then sorting them by contexts and projects) is a core idea of the GTD process, and all the apps I'm going to look at more or less follow similar organizational lines. Now I want to discuss a few finer points about iGTD in particular.</p>\n\n<p>Remember when I said the interface was both interesting and daunting? I want to hit on the daunting (or potentially confusing) aspects of this program. For starters, iGTD allows you to assign 'priority' and 'effort' for each of your items. Power users may like this, but I found it to be tedious. I tried setting both 'effort' and 'priority,' but it quickly became cluttered and confusing as the task list grew. Do I need both? What's the difference? The 'effort' bar (seen in Screenshots 1 and 2) seems like overkill to me, but perhaps those of you with a penchant for extreme organization will enjoy it. If you don't like or need to numerically prioritize and/or visualize your 'effort level' for each item, you can always ignore these functions. The application doesn't care.</p>\n\n<p>iGTD also allows you to add start and due dates to items which, of course, is critical for managing tasks across time. This works great and is easy to do in iGTD. But there's more. With iGTD, you can also mark items as 'pending' or 'waiting for' (this is graphically represented in iGTD by a little Play/Pause button that shows up in a column right before the name of each task. Personally, I think the terms 'pending' and 'waiting for' are too similar. It confuses me. Start dates and due dates are enough. In fact, due dates are enough for my needs.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also not comfortable with the sorting functions available below the task list (see the drop-down lists that say 'Current &amp; Future' and 'All Tasks' in Screenshot #1). There are just too many options. From these drop-down lists, you can choose from 'Current &amp; Future,' 'Current,' 'Future,''Maybe,' and 'All' ... and once you make this choice, you can further filter your tasks by choosing one of these options: 'All tasks,' 'to do,' 'to wait for,' and 'delegated.' This exemplifies the problem for me: there are too many views, filters, and organizing fields. Who might need this level of fidelity and amount of power? Probably people using this app for business, where one is faced with managing many projects over time that involve many different people (and for this, iGTD offers the ability to delegate ... perhaps this is when one might deploy the 'waiting for' tag). I could go on about the confusion factor when delving into dates, reminder tags, notes, links and time tags, but suffice it to say that this is likely going to be the point where some people may say \"my head hurts.\"</p>\n\n<p>I forgot to mention that you can also right-click on each item and get even more options (as seen in Screenshot #2). Here, you'll find the 'Maybe' tag, which is peculiar to GTD. It means 'maybe I'll get to this someday.' I like that. I always have some items that I want to do in some vague, undefined time and place in the future, and it's nice to be able to track these items without cluttering up your concrete time-sensitive items. When you mark an item as 'Maybe,' by the way, the 'play/pause' button changes to a little question mark in a blue bubble. What about the other choices you get when you right-click on a task? Suffice it to say that there are many more options, and the best way to see it is to try the free demo for a week or so. In my opinion, the developer did a fine job in offering up so many methods and shortcuts and sub-menus, etc. to organize your data, but I reiterate that it may be too much to easily grasp for many users. Here are a few more screenshots for you to peruse [screenshots removed]:</p>\n\n\n<p>The first of these three is an image of the 'QuickAdd' box (screenshot #3). This is an example of excellent system-wide integration. I can be surfing the web, hit the F6 function key (provided iGTD is running), and this handy quick-entry box will pop up. I like this, but as you'll see in the screenshot, I'm still not sure what to do with those 'pending' and 'waiting' checkboxes. Screenshot #4 shows yet even more options available from the Dock (with a right-click on the Dock icon). That reminds me, iGTD ALSO offers a menu item up in the Mac menu bar. This is yet another way to quickly add your data, synch your data, and categorize your data. Finally, screenshot #5 shows the iGTD Services menu. Why show this? Because I love Apple's Services menu, and it's surely one of the least used features on the Mac. <p>\n\n</p>The useful Service item here is this: if you highlight some text in whatever program you are currently using, you can go to the Services menu (click on the program name in the Apple Menu Bar and choose 'Services' - it's available in every application you use) and choose iGTD. Here, you'll find 'Put to iGTD inbox.' iGTD does not need to be running. What this will do is open up iGTD, create a new task in your inbox, and place the highlighted text in the 'Task Notes' field of iGTD. That's handy &mdash; you can't use the F6 key to enter new data, after all, if iGTD is not running. But you can always use Apple Services. (Take a look at your Services menu. You may be surprised at how many apps offer little time-saving shortcuts here).</p>\n\n<h3>The Verdict</h3>\n\n<p><em>1. Could I figure out how to use the application with minimal fuss (preferably without referring to documentation)?</em></p>\n<p>I could figure out the basics, but some aspects of the program baffle me.</p>\n\n<p><em>2. Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?</em></p>\n<p>I was enthusiastic for several months, then my usage trailed off. I was only using a fraction of the programs power, and that bugged me. I got tired of looking at all those options and blank fields that I just didn't require for my basic life organization needs.</p>\n\n<p><em>3. How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?</em></p>\n<p>Extremely well. From the Services menu, to the Menu Bar item, to the Dock menu, to the function 'hot keys,' to the integration with tons of other apps, iGTD is extremely integrated, and extremely powerful. According to the developer's website, iGTD integrates with Quicksilver, LaunchBar, Safari, Firefox, Camino, BonEcho, Opera, Apple Mail, MailTags 2.0, Microsoft Entourage, NetNewsWire, endo, Journler, Yojimbo, DEVONthink Pro, Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, TextEdit, TextMate, TextWrangler, Finder, PathFinder, EagleFiler, MacJournal, Mori, WebnoteHappy and VoodooPad Pro.</p>\n\n<p><em>4. How well could I manage all of my tasks (work, home, play, etc.)</em></p>\n<p>Very easily, but it got confusing when I started to organize by dates, pending, future, maybes, etc. However, I want to caveat this: you don't have to use all of the available options and power features. And remember, we're talking about a free application here. Maybe you could live with a few too many options for the cost of a donation to the developer.</p>\n\n<p><em>5. How did the program 'feel?' How 'Mac-like' is it?</em></p>\n<p>It feels complex and heavy. I tend to initially like complex and heavy applications (probably just because of the 'gee whiz' factor, as in 'gee whiz, look at all the things I could do with this'). But I find that, after some time, complex and heavy just weighs me down. It comes down to the difference between what I <em>could</em> theoretically do with a program and what I really <em>am</em> doing with it in reality. Perhaps some aspects of iGTD wouldn't be so confusing if I were better versed in the semantics of GTD. But I'm a novice, and I think the winner in this war of GTD-based task organizers will be the one that doesn't require a customer to know much about GTD. It should simply make sense, shouldn't feel bloated and it should be a pleasure to use &mdash; the elusive Mac-like quality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>: this will remain a strong GTD task management contender for the Mac because it is rich in features, looks great and is free. When you consider that this is made by one person, as opposed to a powerhouse Mac software company (like <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/\">OmniGroup's OmniFocus</a> ... which I'll look at next), it really deserves to be a contender. It's a great piece of software. If you are a GTD wizard, you will likely love this program. If you are not, you may find it's a bit like using a chain saw to cut butter. The last word: <a href=\"http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/iGTD2/index.html\">iGTD Version 2</a> is now being developed (you can try an Alpha release of it by visiting the <a href=\"http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/iGTD2/index.html\">developer's site</a>). It'll be worth another look once this new and improved version hits the streets.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, I better add that 'GTD' and 'Getting Things Done' are registered trademarks of <a href=\"http://www.davidco.com/\">David Allen &amp;  Co</a>. I don't want to get sued.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I've decided to get better organized in 2008, so I've been trying out task management solutions for the Mac.<br /><br />What I'm looking for is a well-designed application with powerful features that cleanly integrate with the Mac operating system. I want to be able to group my varied tasks into project groups that are easy to view and are logically organized. I want tag my list items so they are easy to find and search.  I want one central place where I can quickly see what I have to do today and what I have to do next. I want a central place to store <em>everything</em> in my head. Above all, I want to <em>enjoy</em> using this application. No, more ... I want an application that makes me <em>want to use it</em>. A tall order, perhaps, but this is what the Mac user experience is all about.</p>\n<h3>Seeking Alternatives to Apple's Mail/iCal</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, I think Apple missed the mark with their improved Mail/iCal 'to do' management introduced with Mac OS X Leopard. Granted, it's better than what existed in Mac OS X Tiger and all other previous OS X versions (which, essentially, was nothing). But it's still not there. I tried using the 'Apple option' for a couple of weeks before I abandoned it. While the Mail/iCal solution is simple and well-integrated and may be enough for many people, it's just not working out for me. It doesn't feel right. I don't like the overly simplistic to-do list in Mail. I can't group items into bigger categories or projects. I can't tag items. I can't easily archive completed items. I don't like how it integrates with iCal. As for iCal, the to do list view is fine is you just have a few items, but it quickly becomes unwieldy and hard to read as more are added. I could go on. Suffice it to say that Apple's offerings seemed underpowered to me, so I moved on.</p>\n<p>The good news is that there are an overwhelming number of third-party task management applications out there for the Mac user (there are also a number of plug-ins available to enhance Mail and iCal task management and a host of web-based solutions to help manage your life). That's the great thing about the Mac - the third-party developers who make applications for Mac OS X are unmatched on any platform. I truly believe that.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The bad news is that it's hard to know where to start because there are so many choices. My solution? I chose to focus on a peculiar subset of task management applications based on a system called <a href=\"http://www.davidco.com/\">Getting Things Done</a>. Why? Because many geeky mac users that I respect are oddly enthusiastic about this model, and have been for quite some time.</p>\n<h3>Getting Things Done on the Mac</h3>\n<p>If you follow the mac community buzz, you may have heard of <a href=\"http://www.davidco.com/\">David Allen's 'Getting Things Done'</a> framework for, well, getting things done. Over the course of the past year, it seemed I couldn't escape the chatter about this revolutionary way to manage one's daily and long-term tasks. Intrigued by the noise, I checked out an audiobook of 'Getting Things Done' from the library. Allen's ideas are indeed innovative and clever.</p>\n<p>In essence, GTD is a systematic way to organize your thoughts that begins with dumping out the contents of your brain in an 'inbox,' then organizing those things along the lines of when you plan to get to them (e.g. today, next week, someday), in what context you will do these things (e.g. at the computer, at work, on the road), and how you group these things (into different projects).  GTD is way of capturing all these little bits of 'things I want to do' and 'things I need to do' so you don't have to worry about remembering them all. Once you get all those thoughts down, GTD offers up a nifty way to organize it in a meaningful way over time.<br /><br />At some point, Mac developers who adhered to the GTD model began creating clever applications and scripts to capture this process. While I haven't closely followed the evolution of this development, I noticed that it seemed to really get going in mid-2006 ... and this most certainly had something to do with organization guru <a href=\"http://www.merlinmann.com/\"> Merlin Mann</a> of <a href=\"http://www.43folders.com/\">43 Folders</a>, whose tireless efforts helped to popularize this system, particularly on the Mac platform.<br /><br />Over the course of 2007, I came to associate GTD with Mac task management as more and more applications based on this model began to appear. Over time, I've watched as available mac-based GTD programs evolved from the relatively simple (see <a href=\"http://kinkless.com/kgtd\">kinklessGTD</a>) to the increasingly sophisticated (see <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/\">OmniFocus</a>, <a href=\"http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/\">iGTD</a>).</p>\n<h3>The 2008 showdown</h3>\n<p>As the options continue to evolve and refine, I think we're heading for a final shake out in 2008. My prediction: this will be the year for the Killer Task Management Application for the Mac, and that application is going to be based on the GTD model.<br /><br />This will be the year when a small handful of really great Mac-based task managers vie for the mainstream &mdash; you may never have heard of GTD, but if these task managers are successful, you won't need to know anything at all about <a href=\"http://www.davidco.com/\">David Allen's system</a>. All you'll have to do is pick your favorite and start getting organized.</p>\n<p>Here are the applications that I will compare: <a href=\"http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/\">iGTD</a>, <a href=\"http://www.culturedcode.com/things/\">Cultured Code Things</a>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightbeep.com/\">Midnight Inbox</a>, <a href=\"http://www.coalmarch.com/products/park.php\">coalmarch Park</a> and <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/\">OmniFocus from OmniGroup</a>.<br /><br />As the dust settles over the next year, I think that one application will stand out above the rest. I've made my choice, but I'll save my opinion for the end of this series.</p>\n<h3>How I will review these apps</h3>\n<p>To keep things simple, I evaluated these power organization apps with a few questions in mind:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Could I figure out how to use the application with minimal fuss (preferably without referring to documentation)?</li>\n<li>Was I still enthusiastic about using the application after a week of use?&nbsp; </li>\n<li>How well does the app integrate into the Mac OS?&nbsp; </li>\n<li>How well could I manage all of my tasks (work, home, play, etc.)&nbsp; </li>\n<li>How did the program 'feel?' How 'mac-like' is it?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This last point may need a little clarification. You may have heard or read that a particular program is 'mac-like.' What this means is this: Apple software is generally renowned for simplicity, consistency, lack of clutter, and a great user interface. A 'mac-like' application, then, exemplifies these qualities. I also consider a program to be 'mac-like' if the interface is instantly familiar and obvious because it's similar to other Apple programs I use, such as the Finder or iTunes. Last but not least, a good mac application should integrate seamlessly with the rest of the Mac OS.</p>\n<p>In the next post, I'll begin the comparison.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I had two problems with this website over the weekend.</p>\n<p>First, I was unable to view or send files to this site for over 48 hours. I was able to see my files via the online 'control panel' of my web host. However, I could not connect using HTTP (viewing from a web browser) or FTP (transferring files using an FTP application). I only had this problem for this specific website. My internet connection was working just fine, and I could connect to my other sites without a problem.</p>\n<p>Second, when I viewed the files for this site via the online host 'control panel' of my web host (during the period of no-access, I could still see the files this way and only this way), I discovered that my style sheet...the one I had painstakingly and lovingly created over weeks...was zero kilobytes in size. All of my CSS information was gone. My most recent backup was a week old, and I had changed a lot during that week. Mea culpa. I probably will never know why this file was erased. It could have been an FTP transmission error, it could have been the fault of the (previous) <a href=\"http://order.1and1.com\">company</a> hosting this site. The point is it does not matter &ndash; I should have had it backed up.</p>\n<p>I'm happy to say that my problems are solved. My connection is up and running on a <a href=\"http://www.bluehost.com/track/viewfromthedock/text1\">brand new web host</a>. I decided to switch to a new host as a result of this bad experience. I also have my style sheet back in order, which I had to manually re-create. Here are the lessons learned.</p>\n<h3>Lesson #1</h3>\n<p>If you're having a weird connectivity problem, <strong>check your router</strong> first (if you have one). It turns out my problem was not with my service provider, but was with my router. For some reason it was blocking my access to this specific server space on my web host only. My host (<a href=\"http://order.1and1.com\">1&amp;1</a>) never figured this out, and I wasted a weekend talking to tech support. All they could tell me was that it must be <em>my</em> problem because they could not find any errors on their end (more on <em>how</em> they told me this later).</p>\n<p>My solution was not as simple as resetting the router. I tried this early on. I unplugged it, then plugged it back in. I rebooted my mac. I tried to force a change to my external IP address in case that address was being blocked by 1&amp;1. Nothing worked. Then, over two days later, I thought, 'Hey, what if I plugged my Ethernet cable directly into my primary mac?' If you are a network-saavy person, perhaps that would have been the first thing you might have tried. For me (definitely not network-saavy), it didn't occur to me to take the router entirely out of the equation. Why? I had online access for all my macs in the house through this router, and I could access all sites ... except this ONE SITE. I thought resetting it would fix any issues.</p>\n<p>At any rate, my connection worked just fine after I connected my ethernet directly to my mac, and now I had isolated the problem to my router. The lesson here is this: if you try resetting your router and rebooting your mac and you still have a connectivity problem, it's worth a shot to take your router out of the loop to see if that helps (and thus isolate your problem). This is easy to do and it's a good first step before you call tech support. In my case, I discovered that there was a firmware update available for my router (I'm using the Linksys WRT54G). Once I <a href=\"http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_CASupport_C2&amp;childpagename=US%252FLayout&amp;cid=1166859837401&amp;packedargs=sku%253DWRT54G&amp;pagename=Linksys%252FCommon%252FVisitorWrapper&amp;lid=3740137401B01&amp;displaypage=download%23versiondetail\">updated my firmware</a>, the problem was solved. I'm not sure if the fix was the firmware or because the firmware wiped out some corrupt settings or data. In either case, I learned that there is no way to tell if you router is up to date unless you go online and manually check. There's no auto 'check for update' feature in this wireless router model, at least.</p>\n<p>Since we're talking about routers, I'll add that a hardware router is your best firewall defense - it effectively hides your internal addresses and devices from the outside world. In other words, all the outside world sees on my home network is my router - nothing else. It's worth getting one, in my opinion; and it's necessary if you want wi-fi in your home and/or you are sharing one connection with multiple macs). The built-in Mac OS firewall is good (don't forget to TURN IT ON - it's not on by default when you install Leopard!), but you're first and best line of defense is a hardware router. My Linksys was cheap ($50) and it's worked well for me, save for this weekend. When I'm in the market for a new wireless router, I think I'll go with an Apple product. Why? Ease of setup, ease of configuration. Period. If you have a Linksys, you know what I mean. The browser-based interface isn't very intuitive. (Note to Linksys wireless router owners, check your web-based admin panel for the link that says 'firmware update' if you find you need such an update. It's pretty straight-forward).</p>\n<h3>Lesson #2</h3>\n<p>Choose a web host carefully.</p>\n<p>Cheapest is not always best. I know this to be true, but I admit I choose 1&amp;1 because of the price. I have to say it worked well for me until I needed support. I called 1&amp;1 three times this weekend. Each time, a live person answered the phone within a minute. That was impressive, but my experience went downhill from there. When I called 1&amp;1 on Friday, I was told to wait four hours before trying to connect to viewfromthedock.com and it would probably work. When I tried to get a bit of an explanation of why this might be so, I was told that I must have been trying to connect to my files too many times in too short of a period of a time. Because of this, my IP address was temporarily blocked. I thought this was strange, since I was doing nothing out of the ordinary. Alas, twelve hours later I had the same problem. I called 1&amp;1 again. This time I was asked to try a 'traceroute.' The tech support guy then proceeded to explain how to do this on a PC. When I said I was on a mac, he told me to forget it and that my issue would be sent to 'Level 2' tech support. I was also told I would be contacted. Lastly, he told me to wait for 24 hours until I tried to connect to my site again. Quite frustrating. I was annoyed that I still could not transfer files to my site. And I was annoyed that my use of a mac seemed to stop tech support dead in their tracks - this despite me telling him that I knew how to do <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute\">traceroute</a> and could take a screenshot for him of the result. By Sunday night, I had still not heard from anyone, so I called again. This tech support helper seemed to have no prior knowledge of me ever contacting 1&amp;1. I don't blame him, of course. I do fault whatever tracking system they are using. All he could tell me was that the problem was likely located at my computer, not with 1&amp;1. This was actually quite helpful, and led me to the router solution. I then switched to <a href=\"http://order.and1.com/\">1&amp;1</a> to <a href=\"http://www.bluehost.com/track/viewfromthedock/text1\">Bluehost</a>.</p>\n<p>Why? I had actually been pondering a move to this hosting company for a while. This gave me the push I needed. Bluehost is known for good customer service, and they are known to be mac-friendly. The biggest reason for me, though, is that they support <a href=\"http://www.rubyonrails.org/\">Ruby on Rails</a> development. 1&amp;1 does not officially support this. Since I'm trying to learn Ruby on Rails, it made sense to jump to a host with good built-in support. Price-wise, it's not that much more expensive if you sign up for the two-year package. I'm not crazy about the two-year lock-in, but it did lower the price to the equivalent of $6.95 a month. That equates to $50 more than 1&amp;1 for a two year time block. Not too bad. The control panel is a little confusing. My friend <a href=\"http://www.aliensecretion.com/\">Brandon</a>, a Bluehost user, pointed this out. The vote's still out for me. I can say that I love the ease with which one can backup files and databases with Bluehost. As you might imagine, I checked out this feature first! I'll post on my Bluehost experience more at a later date after I've used it for awhile. I think the web is lacking good third-party reviews of hosting services. If you've ever searched for an independent review of a web host, you know what I mean. Search engines generally return dubious 'top 10' lists &mdash; I say 'dubious' because I don't trust these sources.</p>\n<h3>Lesson #3</h3>\n<p>Transferring a WordPress installation from one host to another is surprisingly simple.</p>\n<p>The easy part is copying all your WordPress files from the old server to the new one. There's nothing to it: you just copy them over. The more difficult part is transferring your MySQL database. Conceptually, it goes like this: you copy all of your files over. Then you export your <a href=\"http://www.mysql.com/\">MySQL</a> database that holds all your WordPress posts, comments, etc. Then you import that information into a new MySQL database on your new host. Lastly, you change your WordPress configuration file so it properly points to this new database (if you use Wordpress, this is the same <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress\">wp_config.php</a> file that you modified when installing WP. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">I've included four screenshots here to illustrate what this looks like</span>. Note that your host may have a set-up that looks different than mine, but the options will be the same if your host uses MySQL and <a href=\"http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php\">phpMyAdmin</a>. For a quick checklist, check out <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Backing_Up_Your_Database\">these Wordpress Codex instructions</a>.</p>\n<h3>Lesson #4</h3>\n<p>Develop your site design locally on your mac, then transfer the finished theme over to your live site. Fortunately, this is easy on a mac. Why did I not do this for my site? I actually did, but once I uploaded my 'finished' theme I decided to totally change it. I was lazy, in short. I decided to just kept editing my live WordPress installation directly on the server using the <a href=\"http://www.panic.com/transmit/\">Panic Transmit</a>. The easy mac solution for running a virtual server on your mac is called <a href=\"http://www.mamp.info/en/index.php\">MAMP</a>. It's dead simple to set up. It includes a dashboard widget that allows you to easily start and stop your local server. What a cool tool. And it's free.</p>\n<p>That's it for this post. Oh, and don't forget to<a href=\"/2007/11/10/a-layered-backup-scheme/\"> back up your data</a> .</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Now that I've finally settled on a layout for this new site (after toying with it for a few weeks), I am going to polish it up so I can offer the basic design as a free <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">Wordpress</a> template. Trust me, it needs some  serious polishing. But I think it's almost there. I've got to know Wordpress pretty well during the exercise of designing 'View from the Dock'. I'll share some of what I learned in Wordpress in future posts. Next, I'm going to migrate this design to <a href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/\">RapidWeaver</a>. The RW site will be a little different, because I want to offer it up with user-controlled colors and such.<br /><br />I've been using Wordpress and RapidWeaver for about the same amount of time. In future posts, I'm going to talk about the strengths and weaknesses of each. In the end, I hope to provide a good overview of the capabilities of each platform. I can say that, while I really love the countless ways I can modify and tweak a Wordpress theme (this site began life as the <a href=\"http://themes.wordpress.net/columns/2-columns/163/wordpress-default-15/\">Kubrick Default theme</a> that we all start out with when installing WP), I miss the simplicity and style that RapidWeaver offers. However, RapidWeaver isn't quite as extensible or as easy to bend to your will. Which is the better choice? The answer, of course, depends on your needs. Certainly these two platforms are not the same animal, but they do offer <em>roughly</em> the same capabilities &mdash; I know that some might argue that WP is a blogging platform while RW is a web design tool that includes the ability to add blogs ... While this is true, I've found that both packages can, more or less, do the same thing. More to come on this. I've spent pretty much this entire weekend on this site design, so I'm going to call it a night and get away from the mac for a while.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>With the advent of Mac OS 10.5 Leopard, backup is now easier than it&rsquo;s ever been. Using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Time Machine<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a simple process: you&rsquo;re asked if you want to use it on an external disk as soon as the disk mounts. You choose &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; Then, you choose which folders to exclude from the backup (which is not very intuitive ‚Äî you have to add folders to subtract them from the back up). At any rate, that&rsquo;s about it. You&rsquo;re done. The only thing you have to remember to do, if you&rsquo;re using an external drive, is to turn it on (that&rsquo;s if you don&rsquo;t leave your computer and external drives on when not in use to save power). That&rsquo;s nice. That&rsquo;s easy.  Time Machine, as you likely know, allows you to go back in time to recover lost files. This is a welcome addition to my backup scheme. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But it&rsquo;s not the end-all of backup for two reasons: ¬†it&rsquo;s not a bootable clone and the backup is stored on a local drive either inside or next to your primary mac. The bootable part is important if you want to be able to keep on working if your primary drive dies. Having your most critical data stored somewhere other than home is important because fires, floods, and terrible things can happen. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here are a few additional steps (in addition to using Time Machine) ¬†I take to keep me covered for almost any scenario. First, I ensure I always have a bootable clone. I use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SuperDuper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the popular little backup app that allows you to make an exact mirror copy of your primary drive. Because SuperDuper makes your backup bootable, and because it&rsquo;s an exact replica of your drive, you can keep on working if your main drive dies. (note that SuperDuper is not yet Leopard-ready as of the time of this post)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you have more than one mac in your home, the bootable backup is even handier. Say that you have to send your iMac in to get repaired after a hard drive failure. It&rsquo;s gone for two weeks. But, during this time, you need to keep working with the applications and files that were on that computer. No problem. All you need to do is plug in your external drive to one of your other macs and boot up from that drive (Preferences: Startup Disk). It&rsquo;s not going to be as fast as using your primary mac, and the cloned copy might be a few days old &hellip; but, trust me, it beats the alternative. Alternatively, if you&rsquo;re in the middle of some critical work that you must finish and you don&rsquo;t have a second mac, a bootable clone allows you to keep on working on that machine. When you&rsquo;re done, then you can send in your imac for repair. Of course, if you have a macpro, then you probably have more than one internal drive and you can fix your dead drive all by yourself. The key to backup, of course, is frequency and consistency. You need to do it often and on a set schedule. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That&rsquo;s why I paid for SuperDuper instead of using the free built-in Disk Utility or the free <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Carbon Copy Cloner<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It has a &lsquo;Smart Update&rsquo; feature. Those other two do the job well, but the don&rsquo;t have this feature. This means that SuperDuper only replaces what is needed to make your backup identical to your source disk. you&rsquo;ll appreciate this feature immediately if you have a lot of data. For me, it means each backup takes about 15 minutes for 120GB of data. A full Not-Smart update, by contrast, can easily take an hour or more. As an aside, SuperDuper is popular for other reasons as well: it is beautifully and thoughtfully designed, it does one thing and does it extremely well, and the application&rsquo;s instructions and explanations are very easy to understand. And do you know why it&rsquo;s called &lsquo;SuperDuper?&rsquo; It only occurred to me yesterday that the Duper is short for Duplicate. That may have been obvious to others, but it only just occurred to me. Now let&rsquo;s just hope the SuperDuper team get the Leopard-ready version of their software working very soon.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, now you have Time Machine and SuperDuper. Should you put them both on the same drive? Not if you can help it ‚Äî you can easily do this with disk partitions, but if that one disk goes, you&rsquo;re going to lose the whole disk &hellip; not just one partition. Having said that, I did place my SuperDuper and Time Machine backups on the same drive. My reasoning? I never worried about having only one disk when I only used SuperDuper &hellip; so I&rsquo;ll take my chances and place them on the same disk. The odds of that disk and the internal drive of my iMac both dying simultaneously are, I like to think, pretty remote. I am using a 500GB <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lacie d2 Quadra<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with two partitions. For SuperDuper, I alloted 200GB. My iMac drive is 230GB. I figure if I get up to 200GB of data on this disk, it&rsquo;ll either be time to think about archiving some stuff or deleting some apps/files &hellip; or it&rsquo;ll be about time for a new mac.  So 200GB is big enough. I used the rest of the disk space for my Time Machine partition. Instead of using Time Machine to back up the entirety of my iMac internal drive, I only set it to back up the user folders.  This setting should give me a lot of space to go pretty far back in time for my files only. For the apps, if I have to restore them, I&rsquo;ll use my SuperDuper clone.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But what happens if you have a fire, flood, theft, etc. and you lose your external drive backups and your mac? You&rsquo;re screwed. Unless, that is, you employ some sort of off-site backup scheme. While there are now a slew of online companies which offer external backup locations for your stuff (for a modest monthly fee), you may ask yourself if this is secure. (There is a good wrap-up of current services in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->December 2007 issue of MacWorld<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by the way). It very well may be secure and I&rsquo;m sure this is a viable option, but I haven&rsquo;t ventured to try this yet. My current solution is a bit convoluted, but I think it keeps my data pretty well distributed. My main off-site strategy is this: I bought a tiny little <!-- raw HTML omitted -->160GB Iomega external drive<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Not only is it quite small, but it purportedly has some patented bump-and-drop protection built in, which can&rsquo;t hurt. I back up all documents and photos from all my macs onto this drive using the free <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SilverKeeper<!-- raw HTML omitted --> backup software ‚Äî just the things I absolutely, positively would be devastated to lose in a worse-case scenario. I then take this disk off-site and store it securely at work. You might also consider storing it in a fireproof/waterproof safe at home, but I&rsquo;m not crazy about that idea. In the case of a fire, this safe could get quite hot. While the papers inside may not mind, I think a hard drive would. You might also consider storing it with a trusted friend or family. Note that I don&rsquo;t back up my iTunes library to it ‚Äî it&rsquo;s huge &hellip; and it&rsquo;s already backed up to my iPod (always with me) and my Time Machine and SuperDuper clone. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, I employ a few odds-and-ends backups. I use a simple automator script to &lsquo;sync&rsquo; calendar, address book and mail to an external server where I host my websites. This <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lifehacker.com post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will show you the basic idea. If you subscribe to .Mac or use a different synching application, this wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary. But this is a cheaper way to go and it gets the job done. I also selectively backup some files to my gmail account (you could also use an external server for this) just for convenience - my wife&rsquo;s Rapidweaver backup, for instance, and some writing projects that I may want quick access to on the go. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, putting it all together, this scheme isn&rsquo;t too complicated. Time Machine\nis automatic. SuperDuper clones are automatically scheduled for every other day (or will be, once the shareware is Leopard certified). Automator synching is manually done once a week (I just need to click a button to sync ‚Äî <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chronosync<!-- raw HTML omitted --> might also be an easier way to do this. I&rsquo;ve heard great things about it, but I don&rsquo;t have any experience using it). Once a month, I update my off-site Iomega disk. This certainly isn&rsquo;t the easiest methodology, and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not the best methodology, but hopefully it will give you some points to consider to develop your own backup scheme.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I will not upgrade to Mac OS X Leopard until the first maintenance update is released. I typically try wait for a few months to upgrade to the next OS iteration for the sake of letting others find the first wave of bugs ... and it's always a battle of the will. Especially when the in-depth coverage begins on the new release, and everyone is talking about the new cat ... and I'm still looking at the old cat.</p>\n<p>The longest I've waited to upgrade was during the OS9 to OSX transition. The shortest time I've waited was for the upgrade to Tiger, which worked flawlessly for me from the start. Leopard, though, will be easier to wait for. In fact, this is the first OS release that is not filling me with anticipatory glee. For one, I don't feel that any of the new features are mind-blowing or urgently needed/wanted. Second, Adobe said that CS3 reportedly won't be Leopard-ready for a while longer ... even though I expect that the CS3 apps I run would probably work fine. And <a href=\"http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html\">SuperDuper</a> and <a href=\"http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/\">DiskWarrior</a> I hear are also not quite ready.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Leopard came later than expected because of the iPhone and heavy, concerted marketing for it started really close to the launch date, which left me with the feeling that perhaps this OS might be heading out the door a little more quickly than it should ... perhaps I'm just being paranoid. That perhaps even Apple wasn't certain that an October release date was going to happen. That's the impression that I got, anyway. At any rate, it's a good goal to wait a bit ... as many people will tell you, if you absolutely, positively can't afford to suffer downtime, better to wait to upgrade and let the early adopters work out the early bird bugs. What's different this time is that I am waiting with far more patience. In the meantime, I am going to prepare for the upgrade and do some spring cleaning.</p>\n",
